<h2 class="nobreak">HELPING YOUR CHILDREN IN SCHOOL</h2></div>


<p>The principles given in books one and two, leading to
the development of the child's faculties find their greatest
usefulness in school work. They will apply to every
part of the child's work and aid in solving any of his
problems.</p>

<p>This is the demonstration ground and the time and
efforts spent in the preceding games and exercises will
manifest themselves in progress in school.</p>

<p>It is best for the child to make his own applications.
You can, of course, suggest and aid, but he should make
his own picture wherever possible. The one making
the effort receives the reward&mdash;which is development.
The child will recall the idea which he works out for
himself more easily than those worked out for him, even
though the latter may seem better.</p>

<p>The following pages will be given over to suggestive
ideas as to how the principles may be applied to different
lessons. Only a certain few concrete illustrations
will be given, as the working out of the details would
rob the child of the opportunity and development to be
gained by doing the work himself.</p>

<p>Children always learn the alphabet by pictures. Alphabetical
books and blocks are made this way. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
because the child learns easily and quickly by this method.
What is true in the early years is true in the later
ones as well. Do not allow him to get away from this
principle of learning by pictures. Follow the plan of
teaching every thing possible by sight. Go out of your
way if necessary to show him the thing he is reading
about.</p>

<p>The suggestions under "The Mind's Eye and The
Story" in Book Two should be continued. When the
child has learned to read have him pause and visually
review what he has read, that is, to stop and see a
mind's eye picture while the book is closed.</p>


<h3>To Remember What You Read</h3>

<p>The inability to remember what we read is without
doubt a general failing and the greatest handicap to
students.</p>

<p>Two of the objects to be gained by time spent in study
are a thorough understanding of the subject matter and
to so fix the thought in mind that it will be available for
future use. It is well to realize that the scanning of the
modern newspaper and careless or rapid reading causes
many adults to forget what they read. We can so educate
the physical eye that it can read an entire paragraph,
or page while the brain is dormant and does not
accept the impressions intended by the author. Often
the physical action of turning the page awakens you to
a realization of the fact that you have read the page
but have absolutely no knowledge of its contents.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h3>Eye and Brain Must Work Together</h3>

<p>This habit of careless reading must be avoided and
for successful study the child should be aided in forming
the visualizing habit.</p>


<h3>"Thought Leads to Knowledge"</h3>

<p>We cannot gain knowledge merely by reading. The
value of reading is in the thought that it stimulates in
the mind. We exercise muscles to get strength. You
must aid the child in exercising his mental muscles by
thinking in order to get mental strength. It is not what
he reads, but what he thinks concerning what he reads
that becomes his, and contributes to his education.
Reading which stimulates no thought is a waste of time.</p>

<p>The disappointment felt in the lack of progress after
time spent in study is not that we forget, but that we do
not really "GET." This lack can be largely avoided in
the child's training if you are willing to help in forming
right habits.</p>


<h3>Visualization the Greatest Aid</h3>

<p>The principle of visualization, as discussed in the
first book, will prove of the greatest aid, because it is
the natural method of using the mind.</p>

<p>To visualize the thought of the author will stimulate
thinking, will increase the understanding of the subject
matter, and at the same time make the strongest impression
upon the brain and thus help him to remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Mississippi Captain</h3>

<p>An excellent illustration of the use and value of visualization
in learning and remembering was given by
an old captain of a Mississippi River steamer. "Do you
know how I learned the river," he asked; "well I just
lay in bed nights and made a picture in my mind of the
river and the course I had to steer. Then I would go
over the picture and see every detail of it and review it
several times. I'd sail up and down that river several
times each night, I'd see every landmark and every danger
point on each trip. That's the way I learned it and
I became a captain when I was younger than many men
who had sailed the river longer than I had."</p>


<h3>The Artist's Picture</h3>

<p>When an artist seats himself before a new canvas he
knows definitely what he is going to place upon it. He
either has a model before him, or in his mind's eye sees
a beautiful picture. He will give weeks, months, or
even years of effort in order to place upon that canvas
a picture equal in perfection and beauty to the one
which he sees.</p>

<p>Notice that a mind's eye picture is often the starting
point of the artist. He strives to place upon the canvas
the reproduction of the idea which he sees in his mind.
He finishes and exhibits his work; you look upon the picture
with your physical eye and through its agency the
result of the artist's effort becomes a picture-impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
upon your brain. You see what he saw, and the longer
you gaze at the painting and the greater amount of detail
you perceive, the more vivid it becomes and the
stronger the impression upon your mind, therefore, the
more perfect the memory of the picture. This is true
of your own mind's eye picture for memory purposes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The more detail you see in your memory pictures
and the longer you continue to visualize them,
the stronger their impression.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>The Author Is an Artist</h3>

<p>In a similar manner an author sits down with his
paper and ink. He sees in his mind a picture which he
strives to paint. He endeavors by his mastery of words
to induce you to see what he sees. He also is an artist,
his canvas is your brain, and if he succeeds it is there he
must impress a picture. The words on the printed page
and the function of your eye are simply agencies
through which he must work.</p>

<p>Words are vehicles of thought and they are the author's
colors; their function is to reproduce objects and
conditions; by their use the author conveys to your
brain the impressions of size, color, form, arrangement
and every detail of his thought. A very few words will
create a wonderful picture, which would require hours
for the artist to paint.</p>

<p>When you look at the artist's painting your brain sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
a picture. The writer, however, is using a code requiring
translation by the reader. Words do not form pictures,
they are merely agencies by the use of which you can
guide your mind's eye in the formation of a real mental
impression. The author succeeds in his effort just in
proportion as you succeed in forming a picture of what
he is describing. When you rob the canvas of your
brain of the impression the author strives to place there,
by letting your eyes pass over the words so rapidly that
your mind's eye forms no picture, then the author has
failed. The mere reading of words makes no lasting impression
upon the mind, but the forming of visual pictures
does. You remember best those books which have
consciously or unconsciously formed picture impressions
on your brain. What you can now recall of what
you have read is largely the recollection of these pictures.</p>

<p>Keep this illustration and these facts in mind in helping
your children. Urge them to properly use the visual
faculties and train their mind's eye to work with the
physical eye.</p>


<h3>Must Read Slowly</h3>

<p>Words are vehicles of thought and are used by the
author to convey pictures to the mind, but at first the
mind's eye is unable to picture the thought as rapidly as
the physical eye can read. The first essential to remembering
what you are reading is to read slowly, hesitating
occasionally, to be sure that a picture is being formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Dead Line</h3>

<p>Never read more than a single paragraph without
stopping to test your understanding of what you have
read. At the end of each paragraph there should be a
dead line; in fact there is a dead line and he who reads
carelessly and quickly beyond this line need not expect
to remember. Put your finger between the pages, close
the book, and review the thought of the paragraph.
Now make a definite effort to visualize the picture in the
author's mind. It is true that some passages make an
easier mind's eye picture than others, but all will make
one which can be used to help in formulating a definite
understanding of the author's thought.</p>

<p>You cannot visualize a thing which you do not understand.
The aim of your study is to comprehend the
author. To visualize the thought of the paragraph will
test your understanding. Making of a definite picture
will increase your knowledge of the essentials. Form
the habit of visualizing what you read. Do not be handicapped
by doubt. Make an effort to formulate the main
facts of the paragraph into an expression of your own.
If you are by yourself, where you can do so, state your
thought audibly, not in the words of the author, but express
the thought and the facts accurately in your own
words.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>No knowledge is yours until you can tell it to
some one else.</b></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Use this test and tell it to some one, or if no one is
handy tell it to yourself, but do it audibly. This forces
a definite expression which can only come from a definite
understanding. Parents should question their children
and encourage them in telling what they are reading
and studying about. The audible expression demands
definite knowledge.</p>


<h3>The Student's Review Sheet</h3>

<p>If the child is reading something which he will wish
to review, as in studying a lesson, a good plan to follow
is to have a pad of paper by the side of the book. After
reading the paragraph write down upon the pad the expressions
and thoughts which the paragraph conveys to
you. This is an excellent plan in all cases where the
audible expression is not practicable. After the lesson
has been gone over in this manner, preserve the review
sheets containing the synopsis of the paragraph. Then
for review, before the examination, a quick reading of
these written expressions of thoughts, which the chapter
contains, will eliminate the necessity of a further
reading of the entire text.</p>


<h3>Apply These Methods</h3>

<p>For a test read the following from "Brain and Personality"
by W. Hanna Thompson. Follow the idea
just suggested. Make a test, read slowly, form a mind's
eye picture, think about it, and then tell the thought as
nearly as possible to some one. All this may take some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
time and effort at first but the use of these ideas will
quickly form the mental habit. Once reading a lesson
in this manner will give better results than many careless
repetitions.</p>

<p>"In some fishes, such as the carp, when the ganglia,
which corresponds to the cerebral hemispheres (brain)
are experimentally removed, they do not seem to mind
it at all, for even then there is little, if anything, to distinguish
them from perfectly normal animals. They
maintain their natural attitude and use their tails and
fins in swimming with the same vigor and precision as
before. They not only see, but are able to find their
food. If worms are thrown into the water where they
are swimming they immediately pounce upon them. If
a piece of string similar in size to a worm is thrown in,
they are able to detect the difference and they drop it
after having seized it. They even, to some extent, distinguish
colors for when some red and some white
wafers are thrown into the water the fish almost invariably
select the red in preference to the white.</p>

<p>"It is much the same with a frog. If care be taken to
keep the frogs alive after the removal of their cerebral
lobes until they are quite recovered from the injury,
brainless frogs will behave just like full brained frogs
under like circumstances. They will crawl under
stones, or bury themselves in the earth at beginning of
winter, and after the period of hibernation is over, they
will come out and diligently catch flies which are buzzing
about in the vessels in which they are kept."</p>

<h3>Longfellow's Picture "Evangeline"</h3>

<p>Use this wonderful picture of Longfellow's. Let each
word perform its intended function and each sentence
form a complete picture.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady</div>
<div class="verse">Sycamore stood by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a foot-path</div>
<div class="verse">Led through the orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Under the sycamore tree were hives overhung by a pent-house,</div>
<div class="verse">Such as a traveler sees in regions remote by the road side,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary.</div>
<div class="verse">Far down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses."</div>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Read again the first three lines, have the child describe
the picture. An artist would spend hours to
paint this picture, yet we with our wonderful mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
faculties can see it in an instant. Add to this picture,
and when finished have the child give a prose description
of it. Other examples for younger children are
given in the Second Book on The Memory.</p>


<h3>Application of Visualization Limitless</h3>

<p>By clear visualizations you can carry any amount of
detail in your memory. This faculty can be applied to
all kinds of information and study. All ideas do not
suggest simple pictures, some are more difficult to visualize
than others. Some pictures are inspired by a
single word, some may be the result of a paragraph or
even pages of description.</p>


<h3>Helps for Learning Verbatim</h3>

<p>To learn prose or poetry should not be difficult for
children who have been trained in visualization. In
some schools they will be urged to use the fallacious
method of repetition, some of it is always necessary, of
course, but most of it can be eliminated by the use of
visualization and the additional helps following.</p>

<p>It is the parents' duty to see to it that the child uses
the methods suggested in these books in all his school
work. Help him at home to apply them to his lessons so
as to get results. At school he will, of course, have to
follow the teacher's instructions, and can silently add
the aids that you have given him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<h3>Alliteration and Alphabetical Sequence</h3>

<p>These are two guides for the mind which are often
wonderfully helpful although sometimes they do not apply,
but use them where possible. Notice the Alphabetical
Sequence and the Repetitions in the following example
of the first verse of Walter D. Wintel's "Thinking":</p>


<h3>"Thinking"</h3>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry">


<div class="verse">If you think you are beaten, you are;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">If you think you dare not, you don't.</div>
<div class="verse">If you'd like to win, but think you can't,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It's almost a cinch you won't.</div>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Notice that the first two lines are half repeated, also
that each line begins with "If" except the last one which
changes to "It's."</p>

<p>In the first lines you have an example of reversed
Alphabetical Sequence in the "b" of beaten preceding
the "a" of are, b-a instead of a-b.</p>

<p>Alphabetical repetition occurs as a guide in the second
line in the "d" of "dare" and "don't". Again in the
next lines of the "w" of "win" and "won't."</p>

<p>Note the alphabetical arrangement of the guide letters
of each line. Write in front of each line its guide
letter; first line "b" of "beaten", second "d" of "dare";
third "w" of "win", fourth the "won" of "won't", these
can be used as guide letters, and if noted will help.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Take your pencil and mark the verse as suggested
and use the words and letters as guides, go over it a
couple of times noting these helps and you will be able
to say it word for word.</p>

<p>Do the same with the other verses; if practical have
the child learn this poem. See that he gets its true lesson:</p>


<h3>"Thinking"</h3>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent3">If you think you dare not, you don't.</div>

<div class="verse indent2">It's almost a cinch you won't.</div>

<h3>Poetry Easier Than Prose</h3>

<p>To quote poetry is usually easier than to quote prose
because in the former you have the added helps of
rhyme and rhythm. See the pictures painted by Robert
Loveman in the following verses; note the repetition,
alliteration and the help of the rhyme and see how
easily you can learn a few verses of this poem:</p>


<h3>"April Rain"</h3>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It isn't raining rain for me,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It's raining daffodils;</div>
<div class="verse">In every dimpled drop I see</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Wild flowers on distant hills.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The clouds of gray engulf the day</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And overwhelm the town;</div>
<div class="verse">It isn't raining rain to me&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It's raining roses down.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It isn't raining rain to me,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But fields of clover bloom</div>
<div class="verse">When any buccaneering bee</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A health unto the happy,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A fig for him who frets;</div>
<div class="verse">It isn't raining rain to me,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It's raining violets.</div>
</div></div></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>See a man in the rain who points out the fact that it
isn't raining rain, "but daffodils". See the daffodils.
See big "dimpled drops" and paint upon them the "wild
flowers on distant hills."</p>

<p>Repeat the picture a couple of times and then say the
verse. Do the same with the other verses. Do not learn
this by repetition. Be true to the method, make a picture
and see it each time you review.</p>

<p>If a single word is omitted or substituted, put special
auditory emphasis on it, speak it louder than the other
words of the line, and you will have no trouble with it
after that.</p>


<h3>Bridging the Gaps</h3>

<p>The greatest difficulty which is experienced in memorizing
poetry is to get from the end of one line to the
beginning of the other, or from one verse to the other.
In prose, when you start a paragraph it is not difficult
to follow through to the end, because all of its sentences
are associated in thought. But the new paragraph begins
with a new thought and there is no association between
the old thought and the new one, consequently
there is a gap between thoughts across which the mind
does not easily travel.</p>

<p>The natural tendency of the mind is to follow
thoughts which are associated in their ideas. One
thought leads to a second which is suggested by its
close relationship to the first. By retracing the processes
you can discover the connecting thought, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
bridge, over which the mind naturally travels in order
to connect two unrelated thoughts.</p>

<p>In memorizing, when coming to the end of a thought,
form a bridge which will connect it and the following
thought and thus guide the mind to the next line or paragraph.
This is a most helpful principle in memorizing
either poetry or prose. If you seek for it you can find
some similarity or contrast, a visual association, or
some sequence, or repetition, which can be used as the
necessary bridge, or connecting link between the two
lines or paragraphs.</p>

<p>Always connect the last thought, the last word, or
phrase of the line, sentence or paragraph with the first
word in the succeeding thought. The process is much
shorter and simpler than its explanation, as you will
learn by practice. Try this plan once or twice and it
will be well nigh impossible for you to memorize without
it.</p>


<h3>Examples of Bridging the Gap</h3>

<p>From "The Buccaneer" by R. H. Dana the last line of
the second verse, and the first line of the third verse are
easily connected by one word, Sand, thus&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">
"And silver waves go noiseless up the beach."<br />
(Sand)<br />
"And inland rests the green, warm dell;"
</p>

<p>The last word "beach" naturally suggests sand, drop
the s and you have the first word of the next verse,
"and", also the "beach", sand, and "inland" suggest a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
natural sequence. Sand here becomes a bridge of
thought over which your mind will easily travel. It is
not always easy to find one word for a bridge, but a visual
picture, a thought, a word, or repeated letter can be
found to aid you.</p>

<p>The poem "Things Divine" by Jean Brooks Burke is
used by students of elocution as ideal for practice because
of the difficulty which it presents. The thoughts
cover a wide range with apparently no relation one with
the other. Often two thoughts are expressed in one
line, and to get them all well fixed in mind so as to repeat
them makes the poem difficult, to say the least, yet
you, who know how to apply your memory intelligently,
may learn it with comparative ease. Read slowly and
note the visual pictures and then go back and "bridge"
them together. This is an excellent example of a difficult
poem to practice upon. It will be an opportunity to
use all of the principles given in this chapter.</p>


<h3>The Things Divine</h3>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">These are the things I hold divine;</div>
<div class="verse">A trusting child's hand laid in mine,</div>
<div class="verse">Rich brown earth and wind-tossed trees,</div>
<div class="verse">The taste of grapes and the drone of bees,</div>
<div class="verse">A rhythmic gallop, long June days,</div>
<div class="verse">A rose-hedged lane and lover's lays,</div>
<div class="verse">The welcome smile on neighbors' faces,</div>
<div class="verse">Cool, wide hills and open places,</div>
<div class="verse">Breeze-blown fields of silver rye,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>The wild, sweet notes of the plover's cry,</div>
<div class="verse">Fresh spring showers and scent of box,</div>
<div class="verse">The soft pale tint of the garden flox,</div>
<div class="verse">Lilacs blooming, a drowsy noon,</div>
<div class="verse">A flight of geese and an autumn moon,</div>
<div class="verse">Rolling meadows and storm-washed heights,</div>
<div class="verse">A fountain murmur on summer nights,</div>
<div class="verse">A dappled fawn in the forest hush,</div>
<div class="verse">Simple words and the song of a thrush,</div>
<div class="verse">Rose-red dawns and a mate to share</div>
<div class="verse">With comrade soul my gypsy fare,</div>
<div class="verse">A waiting fire when the twilight ends,</div>
<div class="verse">A gallant heart and the voice of friends.</div>
</div></blockquote>

<p>To link the second line with the first, think of the
natural association of thought between the words "Divine"
and "trusting." Form the definite visual picture
of the "trusting child's hand laid in mine."</p>

<p>Your thought will quickly pass to the duplex meaning
of the word "mine." It means possession, my own, and
also a mine in the earth. When we start a mine the first
thing to come out is "rich brown earth" and that is the
next thought. Let the word "mine" of the second line
suggest the picture of the opening to the mine and the
pile of "rich brown earth" beside it.</p>

<p>Behind a pile of rich brown earth, see the "wind-tossed
trees", the next thought. Hanging on the "trees"
see huge bunches of grapes, you pick and taste one, this
is the next thought, "the taste of grapes." Around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
grapes flies a swarm of bees, hear their "drone," the
next thought, "the drone of bees." Let the drone of the
bees suggest to you a rhythm and this will bridge your
mind over to the thought of a "rhythmic gallop"; the
answer to the question, "When do you like to gallop?"
suggests "Long June days" the next thought.</p>

<p>June is the time of roses, suggesting "A rose-hedged
lane"&mdash;the natural place for "lovers' lays." You can
easily construct a "bridge" which will bind all the independent
thoughts together. Visualize each thought, and
watch for alliteration and alphabetical repetition.</p>


<h3>Remembering What You Hear</h3>

<p>It is also important that the child be trained to remember
what he hears. Ear impressions are comparatively
light and easily lost. If these ear impressions are
quickly transferred into mind's eye pictures they will
be far more lasting.</p>

<p>Instructions, lectures, sermons, talks, can all be pictures
in the mind, just as you picture what you read.
The act of visualization will concentrate the attention
and prolong it, so that the memory of what is said will
be greatly increased. The visual impressions will also
be much stronger than the auditory ones.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The attempt to visualize the thought of
the speaker is the best method of directing
your attention to his subject.</b></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>


<h3>Use the Hitching Post</h3>

<p>When listening to instructions, or a lecture, in which
there are different points which you wish to carry away
and later recall accurately, use the Hitching Post idea.
Run over a series of words so as to be sure that they
will come readily when wanted. When a point is made
which you wish to remember, transfer the thought into
a quick visual impression, and Hitch it to the first object
of your list. When a second important point is
made, make a visual impression with the next object.
Make your picture strong by exaggeration and motion,
and be sure that you photograph each one.</p>

<p>In this manner you can file away any number of
points. As soon as the lecture is over review the pictures,
see each clearly a second time. If you have trouble
recalling one make the picture stronger so that you
will recall it more easily next time. Review the entire
list of points visualized with the different Hitching
Posts. If you wish to fix them in mind review them
several times in the next few days, so that you make a
permanent impression of them.</p>


<h3>Transfer to Note-Book</h3>

<p>A great many prefer the idea of transferring these
points into a classified note book, where they are available
for use at any future time.</p>

<p>One student tells of having written fifteen pages of
notes from four talks which he heard at a convention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and that some of these notes were not transferred from
his mind to the note-book for at least ten days after the
talks were heard.</p>

<p>Form the habit of letting the lecturer make you SEE
what he describes. The visual impression which you
make will increase your understanding of anything you
hear or read, and at the same time very materially assist
you in remembering it.</p>


<h3>Taking Instructions</h3>

<p>When a person is giving you instructions about the
things which he would like to have you do, follow the
same plan. Simply transfer the words of the speaker
into an exaggerated moving picture and the impression
will stay with you. Another student told me this experience:
"My employer often used to say to me, after
having given some instruction, 'Do you see?' I realize
now that the reason that I made so many mistakes was
because I did not SEE. Now I make it a point to SEE
the things he asks me to do and my reply, 'Yes, I see,'
has a very different meaning. The results are also different."</p>


<h3>Mastering Difficult Lists</h3>

<p>In the child's studies there are often lists of different
kinds which need to be committed to memory and which
present considerable difficulty to say nothing of the time
required. Following are aids and illustrations which
will show how these lists can be mastered with comparatively
small effort and little time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>


<h3>Fix in Mind by Initialing</h3>

<p>Take the initial letter of each of the words which you
wish to remember and use these as the first letter of
simple words which will combine into an expression
which has a meaning. This is very helpful, and is sometimes
called "initialing." We have all learned the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
E &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B &nbsp; &nbsp; D &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F<br />
Every Good Boy Deserves Food,
</p></blockquote>

<p>in order to remember the names of the lines of the
treble clef; the letters of the word F A C E are the
spaces. In a similar way the lines of the bass clef can
be remembered by the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
G &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;F &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A<br />
Good Bees Deserve Faithful Attention,
</p></blockquote>

<p>and the spaces by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A &nbsp;&nbsp;C &nbsp; &nbsp; E &nbsp;&nbsp; G<br />
All Can Eat Goose.
</p></blockquote>

<p>These are simple examples of a principle which can
with a little ingenuity and imagination be applied to
any list to be learned.</p>


<h3>Elevated Stations</h3>

<p>The following illustration shows how a student
learned the stations on the Northwestern elevated road
in Chicago, and will give you a further example of the
use of this principle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I can see Chicago's Oak, divided between Schiller and<br />
<span class="indent65">Kinzie, Chicago,&nbsp; Oak, Division, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Schiller</span><br />
<br />

Sedgewick, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Larrabee, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Halstead &nbsp; willow,<br />

Grace, to Sheridan, &nbsp;Buena,   Wilson.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here only the principal words of the story are used
as the names to be remembered. The story simplifies
the work of preparing and learning.</p>


<h3>Learning the Presidents</h3>

<p>A further plan is the following combination of the
Reminder Picture and the Visual Story used to learn the
names of the Presidents of the United States in the order
of their term of service. Go over the following
Story Picture, visualize it clearly and then from the picture
repeat the capitalized words in their order. When
you can say the list readily, either forward or backward,
go over it again slowly, seeing the object and
speaking the name of the President for which it is a
reminder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Picture</h3>

<p>See some WASHING hanging on a line. See ADAM
looking wonderingly at the washing. Then see Little
JEFF, of "Mutt and Jeff", come up behind Adam. Jeff
turns away, and falls over a MAT. Under it see some
MONEY. Pick up the money and you find an AD.
Take the ad and paste on a SHACK. See a moving
VAN back up to the shack, and when the driver jumps
down from his seat you recognize HARRY (a friend of
yours by that name). Harry takes off his TIE and
hangs it on a POLE, the pole falls over and hits the
TAILOR who runs up on a FILL, from which he sees a
PIER extending into the water. On the pier is a BIG
CANNON from behind which jumps a LYNX and almost
catches JOHN, who runs away, and climbs on a
piece of GRANITE. On the other side of the granite
is a pile of HAY, and rolling off the hay is a GARFISH.
There stands an ARTIST with a CLEAVER in his
hand, which he throws at HARRIS (a friend by that
name). Harris picks some CLOVER, and pins it on his
MACKINTOSH, and it turns into a large red ROSE.
In the rose he finds some TAFFY, which he throws into
a WILLOW.</p>

<p>From this story the capitalized words are reminders
for the names of the Presidents, as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" summary="table">


<tr><td>WASHING</td><td>ADAM</td><td>JEFF</td><td>MAT</td><td>MONEY</td></tr>
<tr><td>Washington</td><td>Adams</td><td>Jefferson</td><td>Madison</td><td>Monroe</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>AD</td><td>SHACK</td><td>VAN</td><td>HARRY</td><td>TIE</td></tr>
<tr><td>Adams</td><td>Jackson</td><td>Van Buren</td><td>Harrison</td><td>Tyler</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></td></tr>
<tr><td>POLE</td><td>TAILOR</td><td>FILL</td><td>PIER</td><td>BIG CANNON</td></tr>
<tr><td>Polk</td><td>Taylor</td><td>Fillmore</td><td>Pierce</td><td>Buchanan</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>LYNX</td><td>JOHN</td><td>GRANITE</td><td>HAY</td><td>GAR-FISH</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lincoln</td><td>Johnson</td><td>Grant</td><td>Hayes</td><td>Garfield</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>ARTIST</td><td>CLEAVER</td><td>HARRIS</td><td>CLOVER</td><td>MACKINTOSH</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arthur</td><td>Cleveland</td><td>Harrison</td><td>Cleveland</td><td>McKinley</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>ROSE</td><td>TAFFY</td><td>WILLOW</td></tr>
<tr><td>Roosevelt</td><td>Taft</td><td>Wilson</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Do this for practice and see how easily you can learn
the names of the Presidents in their proper order and
say them backwards and forwards.</p>


<h3>Studying Anatomy</h3>

<p>Initialing has been used by medical students with
splendid results and has reduced the labor of learning
to a minimum. The branches of the external carrotid
arteries can be remembered by the following sentence:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Some</td><td>Try</td><td>Large</td><td>Feats,</td><td>Others</td><td>Prefer</td></tr>
<tr><td>Superior</td><td>Thyroid,</td><td>Lingual,</td><td>Facial,</td><td>Occipital,</td><td>Pharyngeal,</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>Simple</td><td>Task</td><td>In</td><td>Memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Auricular,</td><td>Superficial,</td><td>Temporal,</td><td>Internal</td><td>Maxillary.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For practice make a sentence of your own from the
initials of the twelve pair of Cranial Nerves, which
are Olefactory, Optic, Motor Oculi, Pathetic, Trifacial,
Abducent, Facial, Auditory, Glosso-Pharyngeal, Pneumogastric,
Spinal Accessory, Hypoglossal. For example,
Oh! Out Motoring Papa Took A Friend and Got
Paul Some Heather. Others can be made, but the one
which the child makes for himself he will remember
easiest.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">BECOMING A GOOD SPELLER</h2></div>


<p>Poor spelling is largely a matter of inattention. Continual
inattention becomes a habit and the child soon
finds himself decidedly handicapped by his inability to
spell correctly. This is largely caused by uncertainty.
He has no definite knowledge to resort to, the result
being doubt as to whether the word is properly spelled,
and therefore uncertainty as to what change to make.
To read a word carefully and to study the letters as they
appear in the proper sequence will usually be sufficient
to fix the word in mind.</p>

<p>When you find that certain letters, or combinations,
are bothersome, use the principle of exaggeration. Have
the child write the word and exaggerate the letters that
are causing trouble, making them three or four times
larger than the rest of the letters of the word. For example,
the word PRIVILEGE, often incorrectly spelled
PRIVELEGE. Write the word correctly and enlarge
the "I," making it several times the size of the other letters;
now have him form the visual picture of the word
spelled in his way:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>In writing the word hereafter you will find that the
visual picture of the word with the exaggerated letter
will come back to his mind and give the correct spelling.</p>

<p>In cases where it is a question of a single, or double
consonant, for example, the word "fulfil" write it "full"
and mark a large X through the second "L."</p>

<p>This will impress upon his mind that one "L" is correct.</p>

<p>Rules in spelling as a general thing, are not as helpful
as a little care, observation and commonsense. The
most troublesome is the "I"-"E," and this one rule
should be clearly fixed in mind:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>"I" always comes before "E," except when following
"C," or when sounded as "A," as in "Neighbor" and
"Weigh."</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Notice the word "Alice." Keeping this one word in
mind will serve largely to overcome this difficulty. "I"
follows all letters except "C," which is followed by "E"
as it is in "Alice." To fix in mind the "E" following
"C" it will be helpful to show the child the similarity of
motion and appearance in writing "C" and "E." Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
examples could be given of this "I"-"E" rule. It will
serve very largely to fix it in mind, however, if you will
have the child hunt out these examples for himself and
make a list of them.</p>


<h3>Use Visualization</h3>

<p>Teach the child to visualize the words which he
studies each day in his spelling lesson. You may not be
able to visualize them yourself, but if you have started
early in training him, he will have little difficulty in
doing so. Exaggeration should be used as an aid in
spelling. It will be easier to see the words printed in
letters from three to six feet high on the wall of the
room, than to see them in pica type on the paper. If
your child has difficulty in visualizing the words in the
spelling lesson have him exaggerate and color them in
his mind's eye picture.</p>

<p>Have the child take a piece of scratch paper and colored
crayons and print the difficult words in large letters,
using two colors, one for consonants and the other
for vowels. If the child has difficulty in learning the sequence
of "ie" and "ei" have him follow the plan of
using two strong colors, such as red and blue for the
two vowels. Have him print all the words with which
he has difficulty, using red for the "e" and blue for the
"i." This color impression combined with the enlarged
letter, will overcome the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<h3>Spelling Exercise</h3>

<p>In order to help the child to become sure of himself
write a list of words spelled incorrectly. Have him go
over them and correct them, or tell what the error is.</p>

<p>Spelling rules should be learned by making visual pictures
of the word to which the rule applies, and not by
simply learning a group of words, the meaning of which
sometimes is not fully appreciated.</p>


<h3>An Example</h3>

<p>Rule&mdash;Final "y," when preceded by a consonant, is
changed to "i" before any suffix not beginning with "i."</p>

<p>To learn this rule have the child print out a few examples,
as follows, enlarging and striking out the important
letters:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Rule&mdash;Final "y" preceded by a vowel is not changed
to "i" before any suffix beginning with a vowel.</p>

<p class="center">
plAy-ed &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delAy-ed
</p>

<p>Have the child print these examples and enlarge
them. All rules should be illustrated in graphic form.</p>


<h3>The Spelling Cards</h3>

<p>For younger children the brightly colored A, B, C,
blocks and picture books have always been helpful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
teaching the alphabet and simple words. These spelling
cards have the advantage of self-instruction with no
possibility of mistake, so that the child teaches himself
accurately and uses the visual sense in doing so.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>These spelling cards consist of a series of simple pictures
on cardboard with irregularly shaped holes cut
beneath, a hole for each letter in the name of the object
in the picture.</p>

<p>The needed letters of the alphabet can be made from
cardboard, each on a card of separate shape, so that it
will not fit into any hole except where it belongs to
properly spell the word
illustrated. The holes in
the picture will correspond
to the shape of the
cards which spell the
name. In this way there
can be no error. The child
can take the picture cards
and find the proper letter
cards to fit the holes under
the picture and thus
learn to spell the name.
These Spelling cards can
be made by pasting pictures
of common objects
on cards about 4&times;6 inches.
Then cut the odd shaped
pieces for the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
letters of the alphabet, using the same shape for the
same letters, mark the proper shapes for the letters
spelling the name of the object on the card, and cut
them out with a sharp knife.</p>

<p>The shapes for the letter cards can be similar to
those suggested in the Game of Matching Cards in
Book One.</p>

<p>Suggested objects for the picture cards:</p>

<p>Cat, Rat, Boat, Apple, Boy, Girl, Fan, Pig, Car, Dog,
Bird, Rose, Bee, Egg, Spoon, Horn, Frog, Man, Cow,
Ball, Baby, Chair, Watch, Saw, Hammer, Nail, Coat,
etc.</p>


<h3>The Game of Word Making</h3>

<p>This game was at one time quite popular and should
be revived and used often. It teaches spelling and increases
the vocabulary.</p>

<p>The only equipment is a series of cards of any size
larger than an inch square. On these print letters of
the alphabet or cut large black letters from the headlines
of the newspapers and paste them on. There
should be about six of each of the vowels, two of all the
consonants, and three or four more of those most used.</p>

<p>Turn all the cards face down on the table and mix
them thoroughly. The first player picks up a card and
lays it face up in the center of the table, the next player
does the same, and so on. The first child to make a
word of the letters turned up speaks the word, selects
the letters to properly spell it and lays them side by
side, spelling the word. If it is properly spelled he gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
one point, but if he has not spelled it correctly he loses
one point, and the letters go back into the draw pile.</p>

<p>Each properly spelled word counts a point for the
child first calling it. A limit of points can be set and
the first one reaching that score wins. If older persons
wish to play the game a limit may be set on the size of
the words spelled, as no word of less than 6, 8 or 10 letters,
whichever figure is decided upon.</p>


<h3>The Game of Salvaging Words</h3>

<p>Pick a large word to pieces and see how many smaller
ones can be made from the letters contained in it. This
is a good exercise for persons of any age and is often
played at parties.</p>

<p>Give each player a paper and pencil, select some
long word and let each write it at the top of his paper.
Determine on a time limit usually five minutes, and
see who will make the most words from the letters of
the larger word.</p>

<p>After the time is up the one having the longest list
wins. It will be interesting and helpful to have the long
list read, each checking the words on their list. Then
let each one read the words which they made and which
no one else has read. It will be surprising how many
different words there will be. Use words like:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Conflagration</td><td>Washington</td><td>Imperceptibility</td></tr>
<tr><td>Consternation</td><td>Gubernatorial</td><td>Permeability</td></tr>
<tr><td>Understanding</td><td>Examination</td><td>Responsiveness</td></tr>
<tr><td>International</td><td>Immovability</td><td>Stenographer</td></tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Game "The Camels Are Coming"</h3>

<p>This game should never be allowed to grow old. It is
"lots of fun" at parties and helpful in vocabulary building,
because it requires an effort, and every time you
induce yourself, or your child, to make an effort good is
accomplished.</p>

<p>Have the group sit around the room and then begin
by selecting a letter and a suffix, as B-ing. The one
starting says to the one on his left "The camels are coming."
He replies "How are they coming?" The beginner
must then reply using one word beginning with B
and ending with "ing". For example: Buzzing&mdash;Bleating&mdash;Braying&mdash;Blushing&mdash;.
Each player must think
of a word to give as his answer. All must remember
the words that have been given and must answer inside
the limit of ten seconds after the other has said, "How
are they coming?" Any word that is in the dictionary
can be used. If a player cannot answer in ten seconds
he must sit on the floor of the room and pay a forfeit
to the timekeeper.</p>

<p>This game can be varied in a great many ways, the
words can begin with any letter and end with any suffix
or begin with any prefix.</p>


<h3>Learning Synonyms</h3>

<p>To help the child remember synonyms and to increase
his vocabulary write a list of words and have him write
opposite them as many words of similar meaning as he
can. For example:</p>

<p>HOUSE&mdash;residence&mdash;building&mdash;dwelling&mdash;abode.</p>

<p>TRAVEL&mdash;journey&mdash;trip&mdash;tour.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHY</h2></div>


<p>Most children will like the study of geography if it
is given to them in stories and pictures as much as possible.
Note how the more modern geographies are literally
picture-books compared with those of several
years ago.</p>

<p>Teach the child to make the pictures in the book his
permanent knowledge through visual reviews. When
he is studying about an isthmus, and there is no picture
of one in the geography, find one elsewhere. Have the
child notice clearly that "An isthmus is a narrow strip
of land connecting two larger bodies." Take the outline
maps and have the child go over them and point out
all the examples of the isthmus. Now have him take a
pencil and paper and draw one. Have him repeat the
definition as the teacher wishes it to be learned, but be
sure that he can SEE and explain it in his own words.</p>

<p>Fix one definite illustration of each geographical division
in the child's mind. Use the Isthmus of Panama
for the isthmus, explaining to him that this location
was selected for the Panama Canal because it was a
narrow strip of land, etc. Make it interesting by
stories.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>In your walks with the children through the country
take every opportunity to explain the different geographical
formations. Find an illustration for an
isthmus even if it is only a small puddle, or if you have
to make one in the back yard with a shovel and a pail
of water. The sand-box method, because it is visual,
has always been a successful one for teaching
geography.</p>


<h3>Visualize the Map</h3>

<p>See clearly the outline of the country being studied,
and note its peculiarities. Put the map at arm's length
and let your imagination transform the contour of the
country into the picture of some object.</p>

<p>Note that the continent of South America is very
similar in shape to the head and trunk of an elephant,
the projection on the Northeast corner being the ear.
Note the similarity in shape between the outlines of
France, Spain and Portugal to a hog's head eating from
a bucket. The continent of Australia easily becomes
the shape of two animals' heads, back to back.</p>

<p>To study any country follow the plan outlined in the
next two paragraphs for the study of the states of Illinois
and Indiana. Note carefully the outline of the
state, and see just the shape which it forms. Note the
location of the principal cities and get their relationship
to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>



<h3>Illinois</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_042a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Take your pencil and draw an outline of this state,
then a line from Chicago to Rock
Island, from Rock Island to East St.
Louis, from East St. Louis to Springfield
and from Springfield back to Chicago.
Notice that the line connecting
these cities forms a triangle. Get the
visual impression of the triangle in
mind. Now close your eyes and see if
you can see the outline of the state
clearly and upon it the line joining the
principal cities.</p>


<h3>Indiana</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_042b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>In like manner note the state of Indiana, its outline
and the triangle formed by the line
running from Indianapolis to Fort
Wayne to South Bend, to La Fayette,
to Evansville, and back to Indianapolis.
Any state may be studied in this way,
or any country or continent. Its size,
shape and the location of the principal
cities may be indelibly fixed in mind.</p>

<p>You will find that impressions made
upon the mind in this visual manner are lasting, and
that you can gather knowledge of geographical locations
which hitherto may have been difficult for you to
retain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>After you have once impressed these pictures upon
your mind, close your eyes again and let your mind's
eye see them. The location of cities, mountain ranges,
rivers, etc., need simply to be visually impressed in this
manner. Draw a line from one principal city to another.
Notice the length and direction of the line and
the figure made by joining them. Draw the lines with
your eyes closed until you have a clear mind's eye impression
of the exact locations.</p>

<p>Follow this plan in teaching the child to visualize the
map which he is studying. Do it with each state, and
each continent, island, or country.</p>

<p>Draw a plain outline map of the continent being
studied, let the child draw in the principal rivers and
mountain ranges, writing the name of each. Explain
how these mountain ranges and large rivers, because of
the natural defence offered, have become the natural
boundaries between nations. Now have the child draw
each country on a blank map, writing the name of each
and placing a dot where the capital of the country is
located, and naming it.</p>

<p>Of course it is not likely that the child will be able
to do all this without reference to the map. The map
of the continent should be visualized by a definite effort.
Let him go over a section at a time noticing the
mountains and rivers, their use as boundaries and the
countries which they separate. After this detail study
have the child observe the map as a whole, and build its
visual picture in his mind. From this visual picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
have him draw all the details possible on the blank map.
Let him go back to the map of the continent, study the
points missed, revisualize the picture, close the book,
and add as much as possible to the map he is drawing.</p>

<p>Do the same with the map of the United States.
Have the child become familiar with the outline, the
rivers, mountains and Great Lakes. Next have him become
familiar with the groups of states, as the New
England States; the Middle Atlantic States; the Southern
States, eastern and western divisions, etc. Each of
these divisions can be visualized separately, the outlines
of the states and the location of the capital learned, so
that an outline map of the group can be drawn as was
done in the case of the continent and its countries. If
this process is continued a very little study of the
United States as a whole will enable the child to draw
the entire country and locate all the states and their
capitals, a thing which only a very few grown people
can do.</p>


<h3>Learning the Groups of States</h3>

<p>The use of initialing will help in learning the names
of the states in their different geographical groups. Use
the initial of the states in the group and make a sentence
using these initials as the first letter of each succeeding
word. Fix the sentence in mind and when you
wish to name the states let the initial or name act as a
guide and suggest the name of the state. Use the sentences
following, or make others of your own.</p>

<p>In order that there be no omission of any sentence
it is only necessary to note that there are eight groups
and four pairs: New England and Middle Atlantic;
Central East and West; Southern East and West, and
Western North and South. As a further check for accuracy
notice the groups as in pairs above; the first pair
has 6 and 7 states; the second has the same, 6 and 7;
the Southern has 7 and 4, and the Western has 6 and 5.
The first two groups have 13 each and the second two
groups have 11 each.</p>


<h3>Puzzle Maps</h3>

<p>The common jig-saw puzzle maps have value if accurately
cut. A splendid game for learning the states of
the United States, their shape, size and relative position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
can be made at home. Lay a map of the United
States on a piece of good cardboard, trace the outline of
each state and then cut them out on the state lines with
a sharp knife. Have the child first learn to name the
states by seeing the blank pieces of irregularly shaped
cardboard. Then let him learn to put the pieces together,
naming the states as he does so. This plan can
be followed in studying the counties in your state or the
countries in a continent.</p>


<h3>The Blank Map</h3>

<p>Another helpful method is to draw an outline map of
the United States on blank paper, drawing in each state.
This can best be done by using impression paper. Now
have the child take the map with the outlines of the
states and write in the name of each.</p>


<h3>The Geography Game</h3>

<p>Have cards cut on the lines of the different states of
the United States. You can use the ones made for the
puzzle map above. On each state card place three spots
in the location of the capital and two principal cities.
Prepare a series of three cards about 2&times;3 inches for each
of the states, and on each print the name of one of the
three cities mentioned so that for each state there is a
book of four cards, the plain outline card of the state, a
card bearing the name of the capital, and a card for each
of the two principal cities. Below the name of the city
can be drawn an object, or a word which will indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the approximate population of the city, by the Number
Code. Make a similar set of four cards for each state,
the state cards to be cut on the map outline, but not to
have the name of the state on them; nothing but three
spots in the location of the cities mentioned.</p>

<p>Some states can best be made in a group because of
their comparative size. Vermont and New Hampshire
can be on one card; Massachusetts, Connecticut and
Rhode Island on another, and Maryland and Delaware
another. Only three cities should be marked on the
cards of these groups, always using the capitals of the
states.</p>

<p>The state cards and the city cards should be shuffled
separately, the state cards laid to one side as a draw
pile, and the city cards divided among the players. The
first player draws a state card and lays it on the table
and has the first opportunity to play with it any city
card he holds. The player to the left has the next turn,
and so on, until someone has laid down the last of the
three city cards belonging to this state card and takes
the book. The one playing the last city card is entitled
to the book and has the privilege of drawing the next
state card. The one securing the largest number of
books wins.</p>

<p>Any player playing a wrong city card on a state card
must forfeit the card to the one who started with the
state card.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>This game requires that the players recognize the
state by its outline and know the name of the capital
and the two principal cities of the state, and of course,
in which state each city card belongs.</p>

<p>The same game can be arranged for the countries of
Europe, South America or any other continent. The
card can bear the names of the capital, the principal
river and mountain range, or the capital and two principal
cities.</p>


<h3>Following the Travelers</h3>

<p>Have the child follow the travelers in the following
stories by actually seeing the geographical formations
as they are named. Then have him repeat the itinerary
by referring to the picture of the geographical formations.
You will find that he can visualize the isthmus,
plateau, etc., only after having clear knowledge of what
each is. This repeated visualization will make a lasting
impression upon his mind.</p>


<h3>The Story</h3>

<p>A man and a boy were out sailing when a strong
wind blew them ashore on a POINT, opposite a small
ISLAND. They dragged their boat across an ISTHMUS
and soon reached the PENINSULA, where they
landed in a BAY. They started out in opposite directions
looking for drinking water. The boy followed
up a RAVINE and found himself on a PLATEAU. He
became lost in a SWAMP and came out on a PRAIRIE,
and inquired at a village where he found that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
return by following a RIVER through the VALLEY.
He made a raft and floated down the river until he was
stranded on a DELTA. He waded ashore and was soon
back at his boat.</p>

<p>The man climbed a MOUNTAIN and looked out
over the DESERT, where he saw an OASIS. Then he
climbed over a CLIFF and followed a CANYON back
to the BAY.</p>


<h3>The Travel Game</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Give the child the blank outline of the country in
which you are going to tell the story of your travel.
Have him locate on the blank map each city you visit
and draw a line from one to the other showing the
route which was followed.</p>

<p>An example: England. I went to England and
landed at Liverpool. I went by rail from there to London,
stopping one day at Gloucester. From London I
went by water to Portsmouth.</p>



<p>In this story you can ask the child to tell you what
kind of houses the inhabitants
live in. You can take a ship
and be collecting a cargo at
the ports. Ask the child what
local products are most easily
found, and other questions
which will show what these
people export. Also the customs
and commerce of the
country in which the story is located can be discussed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STUDYING HISTORY</h2></div>


<p>The study of history is largely a matter of Remembering
What You Read. Children who have difficulty
in remembering what they read, as a rule, do not like
to study history. The lesson made into a visual picture
will fix the points in mind with one reading, but this
reading must not be careless or hasty. Help the child
to read slowly and to pause long enough to make a
mind's eye picture of each circumstance and change.
It will be helpful to take a piece of paper and draw the
scene of the battle. Mark in roughly the hills, mountains
and rivers. Show the positions of the opposing
armies, then roughly sketch the changes which take
place. This drawing will help you to make a definite
picture impression.</p>

<p>Take advantage of the pictures on the page of the
book. The child's mind will naturally associate with
the picture the many circumstances happening before
and after, if he hears or reads them while the picture
is visible.</p>

<p>For example, the picture of the landing of the Pilgrims
on the shores of Massachusetts will bring to
mind the facts which led to their making the journey.
It will also suggest circumstances after the landing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Those stories and facts which the child hears, while
looking at the picture, are joined with it in the mind
by the law of association, and the operation of the
same natural law will tend to recall them whenever the
child sees the picture.</p>

<p>A series of large pictures, which all of the class can
see while the history lesson is being studied and recited,
would help in fixing the facts in the minds of
the children. Children who are taught to visualize
can form their own pictures and have a wonderful
advantage.</p>


<h3>Remembering History Dates</h3>

<p>This troublesome matter is easily mastered when
the child understands the use of the number code as
given in the book on Memory. This principle can be
applied in every case. As a rule, the century in which
the date occurs is not confusing, and the effort can
be confined to the particular year. For example, in
order to remember the date of the Battle of Bunker
Hill, it is only necessary to remember '75, for the
year, as every student will know that it was in 1775
and not 1875, or 1675.</p>

<p>A boy twelve years of age learned more history dates
in one week after knowing how to use the Number
Code than he had learned in weeks before. The knowledge
of how to visualize the lesson and how to remember
the dates will overcome any prejudice or any difficulty
which the child may have with history lessons.</p>

<p>The following are samples of how the Number Code
has been applied to remembering history dates:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>Landing of the English at Jamestown, 1607. During
the first year there was much sickness and the
word SICK is '07. The picture of the Jamestown settlers
"sick on the beach" will fix the year in mind.</p>

<p>The following dates were in one lesson, and are the
word-pictures which a child used in remembering
them. Marquette and Joliet explored the Mississippi
River in 1673. The word COMB is '73. They were
"combing" the river.</p>

<p>LaSalle reached the mouth of the Mississippi River
in 1682. He planted the French flag and had a celebration.
FUN is '82, they had fun when they planted
the flag.</p>

<p>New Orleans was settled by Bienville in 1718. He
had a hard time finding a good place for the city,
TOUGH (tuf) is '18, they had a tough time.</p>

<p>Washington and the Virginian troops drove the
French troops from Fort DuQuesne in 1754. He drove
them from their LAIR, '54.</p>

<p>General Braddock was defeated and killed in 1755.
He was buried in the woods of Pennsylvania. '55 is
LILY, see a lily on his grave.</p>

<p>Some other examples follow: Alaska was purchased
in 1867. 18 may be DOVE and '67 CHECK, a picture
of a DOVE flying to Russia with the CHECK. Or if
you prefer you can use the two words, STOVE-SHACK,
or TOUGH-JOKE, it was a tough joke on
Russia to sell it for so little.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>The Battle of Bunker Hill was June 17th, 1775.
This can be remembered by the association SHOOTING
KILL. Sh is 6; TING is 17; KILL is '75. 6-17-'75
is the date and it is in the two words SHOOTING
KILL, which is easily remembered with Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>The Battle of Bull Run, July 21st, '61. This is
7-21-'61. CAN'T SHOOT (because they ran so fast
they couldn't shoot) and the two words CAN'T SHOOT
stand for 7-21-'61.</p>

<p>Peary reached the North Pole April 6th, 1909. This
can be represented by URGES UP. This is 4-6-'09. He
urges his men up to the pole.</p>

<p>Panama Canal was officially opened August 15th,
1914. This is 8-15-'14. VITAL DOOR will represent
these numbers. The canal is a VITAL DOOR between
the two great oceans.</p>

peculiar idea, perhaps, but it will accomplish the purpose.

<h3>The History Game</h3>

<p>Secure pictures of the principal events in history
and paste them on a series of cards. Have nothing on
the cards but the picture, no printing, or names. Take
three blank cards about 2&times;3 inches and on the first place
the date of the event; on the second the names of the
leaders; if a battle, the opposing generals; on the third
put the name of the peoples concerned.</p>

<p>For example, first card, a picture of the Battle of
Bunker Hill; second card, June 17th, 1775; third card,
General Wm. Howe and General Joseph Warren; fourth
card, British and American colonists.</p>

<p>A series of such cards should be made covering the
events that are being studied at that time. The pictures
are shuffled and laid in a draw pile on the table, and the
cards are shuffled and dealt to the players. The one to
the left of the dealer draws and plays a picture into the
middle of the table, and then any cards which he holds
which belong with it. The next player has the next opportunity
to play, and so on around the group. The
player who places the fourth card takes the book and
is entitled to draw and play a picture into the center of
the table.</p>

<p>Any card which is played in error that does not belong
with the event in the picture shall be forfeited to
the one who started the play with the picture card. The
one getting the most books wins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Game of Famous Men</h3>

<p>Secure the pictures of a group of 48 or more men of
the present and immediate past who are well known in
national or international circles. Place the picture on
one card, the name on another, on the third, his nationality,
and on the fourth, the thing for which he is
best known. The last card can contain more than one
thing, if you wish.</p>

<p>The game is played like the History Game above, and
requires the players to be familiar with the well known
men and their deeds, also to be able to call them by
name, and to know their nationality.</p>

<p>The same idea can be used by making a game of the
famous men of Colonial History; or of the period of the
Civil War; or of the great World War just passed. Do
you know the face of Gen. Haig, his nationality and
principal event of his life? To look up the information
for the cards is a good history lesson in itself. Take the
ideas of all these games and by using your Productive
Imagination make them fit the needs of your study, or
the things which you wish most to master.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">STUDYING MATHEMATICS</h2></div>


<p>Children learn to count by using objects, in the school
room they count the desks, the children, the number
of cards, or blocks. The first lessons are object-lessons
dealing with objects which can be handled and formed
into groups. Digits are symbols which represent objects,
7+3=10, is an abbreviated form for 7 (Apples)
and 3 (Apples) are 10 (Apples).</p>

<p>It is easier to teach addition and subtraction by the
use of the objects to add and to take away from.
The realization of the process comes by seeing the objects
and the result of the change. The digits become
symbols for the objects that the child has been working
with. Counting boards are helpful in teaching children,
for they enable you to continue the visual process. All
methods of teaching through the visual processes should
be continued as long as possible.</p>

<p>The child's interest in the problem will be stimulated
if he deals with objects, or things, and not with meaningless
groups of figures. The problem 127+323+417= ,
is a meaningless one and uninteresting, but if you encourage
him to think that this is the number of soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
with which a general is going out to meet an army of
two thousand, then he has some interest in finding out
how many men the general really has to meet the two
thousand with. This makes the problem read thus, in
his mind.</p>

<p>127 (soldiers) + 323 (soldiers) + 417 (soldiers) = How
large an army?</p>

<p>Figuring a page of problems will be uninteresting,
but if you can encourage the child to introduce the imaginary
objects, it will increase his interest.</p>

<p>Fractions are usually explained by the division of an
apple or some easily divided object. Division, as a process
of dividing a group of objects among a smaller
group of children, is easily understood and interesting
to them. Encourage your child to continue to think of
the objects when dealing with fractions.</p>


<h3>Visualization Always Aids</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>All mental processes should take form in pictures.
The adding of 4 and 7 should be seen in the mind's eye,
if the problem is not written down. A parent tells the
story of his difficulty with his son and this simple problem.
The child got the idea fixed in his mind that 4 and
7 were 12. The father had told the boy that the answer
was 11, and had the child repeat, 4 and 7 are 11, several
times. But the original impression was still the
stronger, and the next day, when asked by the father,
"How many are 4 and 7?" the child's answer was 12.
In some way this impression had become a very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
one and was recalled before the weaker one of the correct
answer, 11. The idea of visualization was brought
to the father's attention during the day by his having
attended a lesson in Memory Training given by the author.
That evening he called the boy to him and said,
"Son, how many are 4 and 7 tonight?" He received the
same incorrect answer, 12. Then he took a piece of paper
and wrote upon it the figures in exaggerated size,
as illustrated on the right. He had the boy look
at the problem for a moment and then look away
and see it in his mind's eye, then look at the problem
again. Thus he placed a visual impression
of the correct answer in the child's mind and this
became the stronger of the two impressions and
was never forgotten. The next morning the
father asked the boy the same question, "How
many are 4 and 7?" and the answer was promptly given,
"Eleven." "Why, I can just see those figures in my
mind and I never will forget that."</p>



<p>This experience is the natural result of using the
stronger sense of sight in preference to the weaker one
of hearing. The conscious use of the mind's eye faculty
in his arithmetic lessons brought this boy from the bottom
of his class up to a reasonable grade in a very short
time. Do not overlook the value of visualization. It can
be applied with helpful results in any lesson or problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Mental Blackboard</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The child can easily learn to visualize his problems in
mental arithmetic if he will begin while young. This is
especially true if you have used the exercises for visualization
given in the First Book. Those on mind's eye
counting and the Number and Letter games are especially
helpful. Their importance now becomes apparent,
and if you have neglected them it will be well to
go back and use them now.</p>

<p>Encourage the child to see the figures in exaggerated
size on an imaginary blackboard; see large white figures
on the blackboard. As soon as the problem is
given, let the ear impression become a mind's eye
picture, as illustrated. The use of this visual
method is gradually being recognized as being
valuable, and will in the future come into general
use. Give your children the advantage and have
them use it now.</p>




<h3>Exercises in Manipulation</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The mind's eye picture of the figures on the
mental blackboard can be enlarged by practice so that
the child can visualize problems of some complexity.
This ability, of course, will come only after continued
practice. Start with simple problems and increase their
difficulty as the child progresses. You will be surprised
to find how he will be able to retain the figures in his
mind and soon will be able to work with them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>Write on the blackboard a column of figures as illustrated
below. (A small one in the house is of great
value in child training. A yard of blackboard
cloth can be purchased and hung on the wall.)
Allow the child to look at them for a few seconds
and write down the result of his addition. Do
not have him write the numbers as in previous
exercises, for visualization, but only the total.</p>

<p>Now, add the first two numbers of the first example,
subtract the third and add the fourth, then
write the total.</p>

<p>In the second example let him add the first
two, subtract the third and multiply by the fourth,
write the answer.</p>

<p>These exercises of manipulation can be varied in
many ways. The length of the columns can be accommodated
to the ability of the child.</p>



<h3>Learning Rules</h3>

<p>All rules should be worked out in examples or illustrations
and visually impressed upon the child's mind.
One visual impression is equal to about twenty repetitions.
Many times children get the idea that the problem
cannot be worked unless the exact "Rule in the book" is
followed. See to it that your children get a broader idea
and that they understand the reason for doing a thing.
The training in mathematics, that is of most value after
school days are over, is, where we understand the reason
and have worked out for ourselves the correct result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
independent of any set rule for working the problem.
When helping the child at home give him practical examples
from every day life as well as those in the book.</p>


<h3>Fractions</h3>

<p>The first step in fractions are often confusing to children,
but need not be if they have been taught to be observing
and to watch for the little aids which help over
the difficult places.</p>

<p>Nominator and Denominator are two confusing terms
to many. If you will show the child that most of the
fractions that he has to deal with are proper fractions,
and that the Nominator, upper number, is smaller than
the Denominator, lower number, and that the same
relationship exists between the words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nominator<br />
De-nominator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Denominator is the denomination of the fraction,
the Numerator is the number of parts. Let the D of
Denominator stand for Down and remember that it is
Down (lower) part of the fraction.</p>

<p>Many scholars have difficulty in giving the correct
answer to the question, What are the three kinds of
fractions? The following is all that is needed to fix the
answer in mind.</p>

<p>Give the PROPER answer. If you give the IMPROPER
you will be MIXED. These capitalized words
are the three kinds of fractions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>Think of a fraction as a part of a whole. When the
fraction becomes a whole, or more than a whole, it is
Improper. It needs to be changed to make it a unit, or
a Mixed fraction, a unit and a part.</p>


<h3>The Multiplication Tables</h3>

<p>These are a problem which every one has to work
with and because the use of them requires speed to be
most valuable there must be a certain amount of repetition
in learning them.</p>


<h3>The Multiplication Game</h3>

<p>The aim is to teach children their multiplication
tables by visual repetition and at the same time to introduce
the game spirit, thus to increase the interest and
to prolong the period of effort without fatigue.</p>

<p>The child can work with these cards himself and thus
by self instruction can learn this most difficult lesson of
Arithmetic, and without any possibility of error, accuracy
is insured.</p>

<p>The equipment consists of a series of eleven pieces
of cardboard about 2&times;6 inches on which are printed in
large black numbers the tables without the answers.</p>

<p>A series of ten odd shaped cards is then made and
the digits printed on them in bright red. The following
are the suggested shapes for the ten digit cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_065a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>(Digit cards should not exceed one and one half
inches in height.)</p>

<p>The digit cards which are the correct answer to the
table printed on the larger cards are then laid in the
correct position and the shapes marked out. With a
sharp knife cut out the shapes a trifle larger than the
marked size of the digit card. The result is a card as
illustrated, with the table and two holes of irregular
shape into which the digit cards with the correct answer
in bright red will fit. No other card but the correct one
can be put into this opening, there is never any danger
of the child seeing a wrong answer to the table.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_065b.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>The only cards which can be fitted into this table are
the two and the cipher making the correct answer 20.
This card with the black 4&times;5= and the bright red answer
20 will make a strong impression upon the brain
of the child, and by use of the strongest sense, that of
sight. At the same time he can repeat the table audibly
and gain the added advantage of the ear impression.</p>

<p>Give the child only one set at a time so that he learns
one table thoroughly. When he has learned it, mix the
cards and place them one at a time in front of the child
and see how many correct answers he can give without
fitting the cards. In cases where there is hesitation
have him fit the digit cards and make sure. See to it
that he is accurate and certain.</p>

<p>After one table is well mastered make a similar set
of cards for the next table. If you do not wish to take
time to cut out the irregular shaped holes for the digit
cards, the place can be blackened and the digit cards
laid carefully on. The cut outs are far better and well
worth the little effort necessary to make them.</p>

<p>For the tables up to 12's you will need the following
number of digit cards; with these you will be able to
work out any complete table of eleven cards. 10&mdash;1's;
8&mdash;2's; 6&mdash;3's; 6&mdash;4's; 10&mdash;5's; 4&mdash;6's; 4&mdash;7's; 5&mdash;8's;
4&mdash;9's; 16&mdash;0's.</p>

<p>After the child has learned two or three of the tables
mix the cards, take any six and see how quickly he can
fit the correct digit cards into place.</p>

<p>Keep him playing with these cards until he can give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the correct answer to any question and give the correct
table as a whole. After the tables have been learned you
can make many tests of speed and competitive games
with several children of the same age or school grade.</p>


<h3>The Difficult Tables</h3>

<p>There are certain tables which seem harder for some
than the others, yet there is often a difference as to
which are considered most troublesome. The 2's, 3's, 5's,
10's, and 11's are easy for all of us. The 9's are as easily
learned with the aid which follows. This leaves the 4's,
6's, 7's, 8's and 12's, remaining to work on. The combinations
that are new in these tables are the following;
all other combinations are known from the other tables:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>4 &times; &nbsp; 4 = 16</td><td>6 &times; &nbsp; 6 = 36</td><td>7 &times; &nbsp; 7 = 49*</td><td> &nbsp; 8 &times;  &nbsp; 8 =  64*</td></tr>
<tr><td>4 &times; &nbsp; 6 = 24</td><td>6 &times; &nbsp; 7 = 42* &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>7 &times; &nbsp; 8 = 56</td><td> &nbsp; 8 &times; 12 =  96</td></tr>
<tr><td>4 &times; &nbsp; 7 = 28*</td><td>6 &times; &nbsp; 8 = 48</td><td>7 &times; 12 = 84</td><td>12 &times; 11 = 132 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>4 &times; &nbsp; 8 = 32</td><td>6 &times; 12 = 72</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>12 &times; 12 = 144</td></tr>
<tr><td>4 &times; 12 = 48 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The first help in mastering these few necessary combinations
is visualization. If you will print them in large
figures and the answer in red, each table on a sheet or
page by itself so that they can be handled and studied,
they will form visual impressions that can be recalled
with ease by almost any one. This is especially true of
children at the ages when they will be learning these
tables.</p>

<p>Repetition seems the most valuable aid, but to be most
advantageously applied it should be a combination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
visual and auditory repetition. Let the child look at the
tables in the large form in which you have made them,
while he repeats them.</p>

<p>Use addition and subtraction. In learning the tables
there are always some which make a stronger impression
and which the child will "never forget." Use these
as starting points or bases of operation. For example,
4&times;5=20, all will recognize this at once. 4&times;4=16, just
four less than twenty, and the subtraction will quickly
give the correct answer. Also 4&times;6=24, or 4 more than
the known point of 20. To take advantage of this it will
only be necessary at first to learn 4&times;7=28 in order to
master the entire table of 4's. The 4&times;4, and 4&times;6, would
be figured from 4&times;5=20, and the 4&times;8 from the 4&times;7, and
the 4&times;12, from the known 4&times;11=44. With these known
bases to work from it is only necessary to fix the one
starred combination in each table in mind indelibly at
the beginning, the others will be easily figured from the
known bases and will become fixtures from use.</p>


<h3>The Table of 9's</h3>

<p>There is a peculiar combination of figures in this
table of 9's, which, if once noticed and perceived,
will make this one of the easiest of the tables.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>9 &times; 2 = 18 (1 + 8 = 9) &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>9 &times; 8 = 72 (7 + 2 = 9)</td></tr>

<tr><td>9 &times; 3 = 27 (2 + 7 = 9)</td><td>9 &times; 9 = 81 (8 + 1 = 9)</td></tr>

<tr><td>9 &times; 4 = 36 (3 + 6 = 9)</td><td>9 &times; 10 = 90 (9 + 0 = 9)</td></tr>

<tr><td>9 &times; 5 = 45 (4 + 5 = 9)</td><td>9 &times; 11 = 99 (2 9's)</td></tr>

<tr><td>9 &times; 6 = 54 (5 + 4 = 9)</td><td>9 &times; 12 = 108 (1 + 0 + 8 = 9)</td></tr>

<tr><td>9 &times; 7 = 63 (6 + 3 = 9)</td></tr>
</table>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>Notice that the two digits of each answer always
add up to make 9, and that each first digit of the
answer is just one less than the multiple. For example,
9&times;5=45, the answer will begin with one less
than the multiple 5, and the two digits of the answer
must add to make 9, therefore it can be nothing but
4 and 5, or 45. This is true in all cases except 9&times;11
an already known answer, but also only 9's in this
answer. This simple idea, when once understood,
will master the table of 9's.</p>

<p>Be sure that the children realize that 7&times;4 in the
tables of 7's are the same in value as 4&times;7, so that the
answer to 7&times;4 becomes familiar with learning the
table of 4's. Ask the question both ways 7&times;4 and 4&times;7.</p>


<h3>The Tables of Weights and Measures</h3>

<p>Some of these we learn easily and always retain;
some always seem confusing. These can be mastered
by the use of the Number Code and the Visual
picture combined. Some examples follow:</p>

<p>24 sheets = 1 quire, and 20 quires = one ream. The
picture of Two Dozen Squires in a Nice Room, will
fix these figures and terms in mind. Two Dozen is
24, Squires is a reminder for Quires. Nice is 20 (2
is N and 0 is C) and room a reminder for Ream.</p>

<p>16-1/2 Feet = 1 Rod, 320 Rods = 1 Mile. Picture a
Dish and a Half balanced on a Rod. Dish is your
code word for 16 (1 is D and 6 is sh) and the Half
Dish makes 16-1/2 Feet on (in) a Rod. Next&mdash;Many's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the Rod in a Mile. Many's is 320 or the number of
rods in a mile.</p>

<p>30-1/4 Sq. Yards = 1 Sq. Rod. Picture&mdash;MISTER
takes a yard stick and measures off a Sq. Rod. Mister
is 3-0-1-4, or 30-1/4.</p>

<p>160 Sq. Rods = 1 Acre. Picture&mdash;See a pile of
Dishes out in the Acre being broken up by a rod.
Dishes is 160 the number of Sq. Rods in an Acre.</p>

<p>640 Acres in a Sq. Mile. Picture&mdash;Take the Shears
and cut up the mile into squares. Shears is 640, the
number of Acres in a Sq. Mile.</p>

<p>792 Inches&mdash;1 Link. Picture&mdash;792 is Cabin, see the
link hanging on the side of the cabin.</p>

<p>4 Rods = 1 Chain. Picture&mdash;See 4 Rods wrapped
around with a chain. 80 chains = 1 mile. Your Code
Word for 80 is Vase; put a chain around it and drag
it a mile.</p>

<p>A few picture associations like these will help in
fixing the difficult points in mind. Associations which
you make yourself will help you most. Be sure to
repeat them at intervals; make them permanent.</p>


<h3>Pictures for Answers</h3>

<p>Familiarity with the Number Code given in the
book on Memory, will aid the child in keeping the
result of a problem. The numbers of the answer can
quickly take the form of an object which can be
translated again into the correct numbers. Many
children will not be able to hold the visual picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of the digits for any length of time. There is considerable
difference in the ability to hold the visual
picture of the digit 127. Many children, and adults,
will be far more accurate and remember longer if
they see a TANK, which is easily translated by the
Code into 127, when the answer is wanted.</p>


<h3>Learning Rules</h3>

<p>The exaggerated example illustrating the rule to
be learned, will make its meaning clear and thus
make the problem of learning it many times simpler
than if it is learned as a group of words, the meaning
of which is not always well understood. It is
always best to understand the rule first and learn
it afterwards. Use the suggestion given for learning
verbatim and the exaggerated example as given
in the suggestions in spelling. After you understand
the rule it will not be difficult to memorize.</p>


<h3>Visualizing Geometry</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_072a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The Theorem in geometry should have the visual
process applied to it in the same manner. Make a
strong picture of the figure which illustrates it. For
example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The square on the hypotenuse of a right angle
is equal to the sum of the square on the other
two sides.</b></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>To visualize the figure, as illustrated, will aid in
fixing this Theorem in
mind. Do the same with
others. Another example
of emphasizing
the important lines as
in the Theorem:</p>

<p>Two rectangles are to
each other as the products
of their bases by
their altitudes.</p>



<p>In the illustration below
the bases and altitudes
are emphasized to
remind you of the fact
that they are the factors
to be dealt with. Notice
that in the first pages of
the Geometry all simple figures are illustrated as explained
or defined. Learn to visualize the problem
with your book closed, work until you can see it
clearly, and you will understand it better.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AIDS IN STUDYING CHEMISTRY</h2></div>


<p>Experiments in Chemistry are its most interesting
phase. Let its problems take form in your visual
mind and you will add to the enjoyment and also the
ease of your understanding.</p>

<p>A teacher of this subject, after appreciating the
value and ease of visualization, worked out picture
combinations of atoms which helped him greatly.
He could see the two atoms of Hydrogen floating
through the air and combining with the atom of
Oxygen and could see the result of the combination.</p>


<h3>Using the Initialing Idea</h3>

<p>The ideas which have been given in this and the
preceding books can be applied in many ways to the
problems of any subject. There is no attempt on the
part of the author to work out all applications, but
merely to suggest a few possible ones and leave the
rest to the student. Each will think of different
methods, and those aids which each one works out
for himself will be most valuable and most easily
recalled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Elemental Substances</h3>

<p>The six elemental substances of the organic world
are: Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus,
and Sulphur, which can be easily remembered
by the following: The Organic World&mdash;Can
Have No Other Principal Story.</p>

<p>The initials of each of the words following
"World" stand for one of the elements.</p>


<h3>Chemical Formulae</h3>

<p>Remembering of chemical formulae can be simplified
very greatly by reducing the formulae to an idea
using the initialing plan; for example, the formula
for Wood Alcohol is CH3OH. This formula in itself
has no meaning, and is difficult to carry in mind.
By using the initials you can easily make some ideas
which will represent this formula and help you to
remember it, as for example: CAT HAD ham ON
HAND. In this formula the C of Cat stands for
Carbon, the H of Had for Hydrogen; Ham being a
Code Word for 3 is indicative of 3 atoms of Hydrogen,
and the O. H. is represented by the O and H
of On Hand.</p>

<p>The formula for Glycerine is C3H5(OH)3, and
can be remembered by the following idea: COME
HEEL O HAM. In this example notice that the first
letter of the word initials the substance and the last
letter the number of atoms by the number code.
As COME: C for Carbon, and M for 3. HEEL: H
for Hydrogen, and L for 5. O for Oxygen. HAM:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
H for Hydrogen, and M for radicle 3 times. Use
whichever method suits you best.</p>

<p>The formula for Carbolic Acid, C6H5OH, or
CASH HAUL O, HAY. The formula for Benzine,
C6H6, or CASH HASH.</p>


<h3>Hardness of Substances</h3>

<p>It is often valuable to know the degree of hardness
of different substances, and these can easily be remembered
by the following list. In degree of relative
hardness the list is as follows, the hardest coming
first.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Diamond</td><td>Apatite</td></tr>
<tr><td>Corundum &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>Bell Metal</td></tr>
<tr><td>Topaz</td><td>Boric Acid</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quartz</td><td>Rock Salt</td></tr>
<tr><td>Iridium</td><td>Kaolin</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Take Kaolin as a basis. The number opposite each
substance in the following list indicates its comparative
degree of hardness in relation to Kaolin:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td align="right">1</td><td>Kaolin</td><td>TIE</td><td>See tie on Kaolin</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">2</td><td>Rock Salt</td><td>SNOW</td><td>Poured over Rock Salt</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">3</td><td>Boric Acid</td><td>HOME</td><td>Built of Boric Acid</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">4</td><td>Bell Metal</td><td>WIRE</td><td>Swinging a Bell</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">5</td><td>Apatite</td><td>WHEEL</td><td>With a big appetite for running</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">6</td><td>Iridium</td><td>SASH</td><td>Irritating the wearer</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">7</td><td>Quartz</td><td>EGG</td><td>Quartz taken from an Egg</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">8</td><td>Topaz</td><td>IVY</td><td>To pass the Ivy</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">9</td><td>Corundum</td><td>WHIP</td><td>Made Cora run</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">10</td><td>Diamond</td><td>TOES</td><td>Set with Diamonds</td></tr>
</table>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>In the list you have ten substances. Kaolin, the
base, is 1, Rock Salt is 2, which indicates that Rock
Salt is twice as hard as Kaolin. Iridium is 6, and six
times as hard as Kaolin. Diamond is 10, which
means that it is ten times as hard as Kaolin.</p>

<p>Learning this list by picturing reminders with the
word of the Code list will enable you to easily recall
these ten substances and the degree of hardness
compared with Kaolin.</p>


<h3>Atomic Weight Table</h3>

<p>Some students of Chemistry have learned the entire
list of elements and their atomic weights. The following
are a few examples of how the list can be
arranged and learned. It will be excellent practice
for you to use this method and make a list of your
own.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="center"><strong>Element</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Code No.</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Reminder</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Wt.</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Code Word</strong></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">2</td><td>Hydrogen</td><td>SNOW</td><td>Hydrant</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.008</td><td>The Saucy Foe</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">3</td><td>Nitrogen</td><td>HOME</td><td>Night</td><td>&nbsp; 14.01</td><td>Deer Sat</td></tr>

<h3>Learning Foreign Vocabularies</h3>

<p>The principle of using a reminder can be applied
with advantage in learning a foreign language. The
majority may learn foreign words more easily and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
permanently by the Reminder Link. In this case the
reminder is the connecting link between the English
word and the foreign word. Those who usually
learn foreign words only by laborious repetition will
find a saving of time in learning by the reminder
link.</p>

<h3>Spanish words:</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td align="center"><strong>English</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Link</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Spanish</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>cold</td><td>freeze</td><td>frio</td></tr>

<tr><td>sing</td><td>cantata</td><td>cantar</td></tr>
<tr><td>full</td><td>complete</td><td>completo</td></tr>
<tr><td>sweet</td><td>delicious &nbsp; </td><td>dulce</td></tr>
<tr><td>window</td><td>ventilate</td><td>ventana</td></tr>
<tr><td>keep</td><td>guard</td><td>guardar</td></tr>
<tr><td>sell</td><td>vend</td><td>vender</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Latin Vocabularies</h3>

<p>Latin is the base from which most modern languages
are derived, and you will find in English a very
large proportion of the words taken directly from
the Latin source. This makes the learning of Latin
Vocabularies simpler than any other.</p>

<p>In a great many cases the word is a direct derivative
and needs no reminder or intermediate step; for
example, the Latin word ANIMAL is the same as in
English, although pronounced differently; or Latin:
ORNAMENTUM, and the English ORNAMENT. Be
resourceful, draw upon your imagination. Note the
following suggestions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td align="center"><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>Reminder</strong></td><td><strong>Latin</strong></td></tr>

<tr><td>boyish</td><td>Puerile</td><td>puer</td></tr>
<tr><td>crown</td><td>coronation</td><td>corona</td></tr>
<tr><td>free</td><td>liberate</td><td>liber</td></tr>
<tr><td>land</td><td>terrace</td><td>terra</td></tr>
<tr><td>dog</td><td>canine</td><td>canis</td></tr>
<tr><td>think</td><td>cogitate</td><td>cogito</td></tr>
<tr><td>mind</td><td>mental</td><td>mentis (gen.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>running</td><td>current</td><td>curro</td></tr>
<tr><td>pleasing</td><td>gratifying</td><td>gratus</td></tr>
<tr><td>soldiers</td><td>militia</td><td>milites (pl.)</td></tr>

<tr><td>shortness</td><td>brevity</td><td>brevis</td></tr>
<tr><td>time</td><td>temporary</td><td>tempora (pl.)</td></tr>

<p>German Vocabularies become very much less difficult
if you search for an intermediate step or reminder:</p>

<h3>Studying Music</h3>

<p>The visual memory is the best memory for music.
Many of the better musicians who learn music readily
and remember it well have the visual memory.
They can see the page, the bar, and the notes in the
mind's eye. This ability can be developed in the
child by the use of the exercises for visualization
given in the first book. When the child begins to
study music give part of the time to practice of visualizing
and memorizing music.</p>

<p>First, teach him to visualize a perfect clef. Draw
imperfect ones on paper or slate and have the child
tell what is the matter with them. Draw different
notes and have him become thoroughly familiar with
them by reproducing them. Have him draw the
whole, half, quarter, and eighth notes, etc.</p>

<p>Teach the child the division of time by grouping
the notes with reference to beats. Write a line of
notes and have him divide them into groups of whole
note value. Then indicate a certain time to be followed
and have him divide other rows of notes into
bars in accordance with the time indicated.</p>

<p>Teach the child the different rests by the same
visual process. Have him write bars of music using
the different rests and completing the bar of given
time by filling in with the proper notes. Teach the
use of sharps and flats and the difference in signatures
by the same visual process. Let all practice
be simple in the beginning and increase in complexity
as he grows older.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>Teach the child to combine the use of the eye and
ear in musical practice. Have him transfer ear impressions
to visual ones by seeing the notes on a
staff as he hears the tone. Write a few bars of a
familiar tune and have the child tell what it is.</p>

<p>Another application of the visual memory is to
look carefully at the staff, then close the eyes and
see it in the mind's eye, then look back and correct
and improve the picture. Another plan is to see the
staff exaggerated in size, covering the entire wall of
the room. This exaggerated picture can be colored
according to the above suggestions.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to take the piece which is to be
memorized, and after fixing the picture of it in mind
write it upon a blank staff. Keep improving this
written copy of music, writing only that part of the
score which is seen clearly. These methods will help
to improve the visual ability to carry a picture of the
page; and continuous practice with them will help
in improving the ability to memorize in this way.</p>

<p>Be systematic in all your efforts. It is best first to
memorize the words, then the air, then the technical
part. A thorough understanding of the composition
and its general plan will be of assistance.</p>

<p>In learning songs apply the principles given in the
second book, and learn the words thoroughly. This
will enable you to devote all of your time and attention
to the technical part of the music. When you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
do not know the words thoroughly your attention is
divided between learning the technical part of the
music and recalling the words. Better master one
thing at a time and do that well.</p>


<h3>Speaking in Public</h3>

<p>When you have trained your child's memory and
created in his mind a feeling of confidence that he
can remember what he wishes to say, there will be
very little embarrassment connected with speaking
in public.</p>

<p>Teach the child to use the Hitching Post idea in
all matters of public speaking.</p>

<p>This subject was covered in Book Two and the following
sample outline of the points of a talk
"Hitched" to the Code Words will be helpful.</p>

<p>A patriotic speech made after the Declaration of
War with Germany.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 (Tie)&mdash;Volunteering for Service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young men are taking off their ties and
waving them in the air rushing into the
Enlisting Office.</p></blockquote>

<p>2 (Snow)&mdash;Great Need of Shipbuilders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A partly built ship covered with snow
which men are shoveling away so others
can go on with the work.</p></blockquote>

<p>3 (Home)&mdash;Public Speakers for Propaganda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speakers going from home to home calling
out to people and addressing them.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>4 (Wire)&mdash;Conservation of Food.</p>


<p>Boxes of food being wound around with
wire so that they cannot be wasted.</p></blockquote>

<p>5 (Wheel)&mdash;Stopping Criticism of Government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting a lot of men gagged and bound upon
a large wheel.</p></blockquote>

<p>6 (Sash)&mdash;Increasing Production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Factory boss offering a wide, red, white
and blue sash to the worker who makes
the greatest increase in production.</p></blockquote>

<p>7 (Egg)&mdash;Lend Your Savings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Putting your savings in a large Egg and
taking out Liberty Bonds.</p></blockquote>

<p>Be original and make an effort. You will soon
learn that these simple pictures will recall the points
of the talk in the order in which you have arranged
them. The hint is all the mind needs, if it gets the
right start you will be able to say what you wish.</p>


<h3>Review Your Studies</h3>

<p>An excellent method of mental development is to
make a practice of recalling the occurrences of the
day each evening. This is especially important for
students. Time should be taken to sit quietly and review
the facts and ideas of the day's lessons. Here
is an excellent opportunity to urge your mind to
think them over for yourself. There can be little
growth of knowledge without independent thinking.</p>

<p>Review as much in detail as possible all of today's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
lessons before starting on the new. One reason you
do not remember more of what you see, read, or hear,
is that you do not review it. Reviewing carefully
will very largely increase your stock of knowledge.
It is not unreasonable to expect that some of the facts
or experiences of the day's work and lessons will
later become as important and valuable as a business
man's papers. He does not hesitate to take time in
the middle of the day to file these papers, or even to
carry them to the vault. Teach the child to take a
few minutes in the evening and review the occurrences
of the day and you will be surprised to see
his mind begin to take on the retentive power of a
vault.</p>

<p>The necessity of repetition will never be eliminated;
it may by better methods be reduced to a
minimum, but cannot disappear entirely. Some
knowledge must be so familiar that it can be used
habitually (by the subconscious mind) without the
necessity of conscious effort, and this cannot become
true without repetition.</p>


<h3>Review Improves Observation</h3>

<p>Another result which is far from unimportant is
the fact that this effort will develop the ability and
the inclination to take notice of things as they transpire.
Many examples can be given of the extreme
value of this exercise, as the experiences of Thurlow
Weed. He had the ambition to become a politician,
but lacked one necessary requisite&mdash;a retentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
memory. The above idea was suggested to him by
his wife. Mr. Weed practiced by recalling to his
wife in the evening all the circumstances and happenings
of the day. He was so greatly repaid for
this effort that he continued this for many years.
Mr. Weed says, "I am indebted to this discipline for
a memory of unusual tenacity. I recommend this
practice to all men who wish to store up facts and
expect to have much to do in influencing men."</p>


<h3>A Word to the Student</h3>

<p>The greatest lesson of education is thought. The
thing you should be striving for and working toward
is the ability to think clearly, logically and deeply.
One of the greatest aids is the knowledge which is
stored in your brain and which you are all able to
recall at will.</p>

<p>Your brain is not like sticking plaster, it is like
putty; you must make an impression of the things
you wish to retain. To make these impressions will
always require an effort, no help will ever be devised
which will enable you to remember without effort.</p>

<p>The ideas given to you in this book are aids, and
you should become able to use them as such. The
principles of memory are scientifically accurate and
you need to become familiar with them and to use
them to add to your success in study and progress.</p>

<p>Do not be like the carpenter who "is too busy to
sharpen his tools," or like the drowning man who refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to grasp the rope because he feared it was not
strong enough.</p>

<p>Use every idea that proves helpful and apply it in
every possible way. There is no intent to give here
all of the applications, but merely to give principles
and to suggest one or two ways in which they have
been used. The applications that are of most value
to you are those you make for yourself. The principles
will cover every need, if you will be resourceful
in their use.</p>


<h3>Get Out of the Rut</h3>

<p>Make an effort. Insist upon your brain waking up
and "getting on the job" and doing its share. The
old method of "learning by heart" requires a maximum
of time and mental effort.</p>

<p>This visual method requires only a minimum of
time and mental effort.</p>

<p>Time is of the utmost value to you. Dr. James tells
us that over seventy-five per cent of our Mental power
is dormant, asleep. Stir yourself. Put a Maximum
of Mental Effort into a Minimum of Time; develop
an accurate and retentive memory&mdash;a worthy servant
to be at all times relied upon&mdash;the very foundation
of your success. You can work wonders with
yourself by intelligent and persistent effort.</p>

<p>The Capacity of the Visual Memory is Unlimited.</p>

<p>Faith is the Atmosphere in which Success lives.</p>

<p>Kill Mental Laziness. It has always been fatal&mdash;it
is as deadly NOW!</p>

<h3>It Can Be Done</h3>

<div class="verse">Somebody said that it couldn't be done,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But he with a chuckle replied,</div>
<div class="verse">That maybe it couldn't, but he would not be one</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To say so until he tried.</div>
<div class="verse">So he buckled right in with a bit of a grin</div>
<div class="verse indent2">On his face; if he worried he hid it,</div>
<div class="verse">He started to sing as he tackled the thing</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That couldn't be done&mdash;and he did it.</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWO</h2></div>


<p>In this last chapter will be given applications of
the memory principles which have been made by
students. Some will be helpful to you, others will
suggest ideas which you can change and adapt to
your own problems.</p>


<h3>Value of Forgetting</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is of as great value to be able to forget
as it is to be able to remember. You have seen
that each time you review a mental impression it
becomes stronger and more deeply implanted in the
brain. When using your Hitching Post for temporary
purposes refuse to see the pictures after having
used them, and your Hitching Posts will be free
for filling any other information.</p>

<p>The unfortunate or embarrassing situations of life
which you wish to eliminate from your mind can be
forgotten by the same process. Each time you allow
this circumstance to enter your mind you see again
the conditions which you are trying to forget. This
is just the thing you should not do. Each time you
rehearse the subject you drive it deeper and deeper
into your mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>To forget you must refuse to review or to revisualize.
There must be an utter absence of this circumstance
from your mind. This will require some determination
upon your part, and a little application
of WILL POWER, but it is not a difficult thing to
accomplish. The best method of eliminating a troublesome
thought is to fill your mind with a pleasant
one. When there is a tendency to recall that which
you wish to forget do not deny it, but rather begin
immediately to think of something entirely different
and keep your mind continuously upon the new
thought and the old will be completely eliminated.</p>


<h3>To Remember Playing Cards</h3>

<p>Those who are interested in card playing will find
in the following idea an excellent method of entertaining
friends. It will also prove valuable in playing
certain games, and above all, it is good practice
for the development of your memory.</p>

<p>Remembering all the cards of a shuffled deck in
proper order is an application of the Hitching Post
idea and the Number Code. Have a word to represent
each card in the deck, beginning with the
first letter of the series and ending with the Code
Letter for the number of the card. For example
HEAD would represent 1 of Hearts, H for Heart,
and D the Code Letter for 1.</p>

<p>In this way the 2 of Hearts would be represented
by Honey; the word Hem would stand for the 3 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Hearts. The word Hero would stand for the 4 of
Hearts.</p>

<p>In the same way a list of words may be made to
represent the Spade cards, each word beginning with
S to stand for the Spades, and ending in a letter of
the number Code to represent the number of the card.</p>

<p>A similar list may be made for the Club cards,
beginning with C for Clubs and for the Diamond
cards beginning with D.</p>

<p>The following list of words has been prepared to
cover the entire deck:</p>


<h3>Card Words</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td align="center"><strong>Cards</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Spades</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Hearts</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Clubs</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Diamonds</strong></td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">Ace</td><td>Seat</td><td>Head</td><td>Caddy</td><td>Dad</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2</td><td>Sun</td><td>Honey</td><td>Coon</td><td>Dawn</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">3</td><td>Seam</td><td>Hem</td><td>Comb</td><td>Dam</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">4</td><td>Soar</td><td>Hero</td><td>Cur</td><td>Deer</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">5</td><td>Sail</td><td>Heel</td><td>Coal</td><td>Duel</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">6</td><td>Sage</td><td>Hash</td><td>Cage</td><td>Ditch</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">7</td><td>Sack</td><td>Hog</td><td>Cake</td><td>Dyke</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">8</td><td>Safe</td><td>Hive</td><td>Cave</td><td>Dive</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">9</td><td>Soup</td><td>Hobo</td><td>Cap</td><td>Daub</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">10</td><td>Seeds</td><td>Hods</td><td>Cuts</td><td>Deeds</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">J</td><td>Statute</td><td>Heated</td><td>Cadet</td><td>Dotted</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Q</td><td>Stein</td><td>Hidden</td><td>Cotton</td><td>Detain</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">K</td><td>Steam</td><td>Hit'em</td><td>Cut'em</td><td>Daytime</td></tr>
</table>

<p>By use of these words it is not difficult to take a
deck of cards previously shuffled by some one, and to
learn the position of each card in the pack. The first
card will be represented by its corresponding word
and visually associated with the first word of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Code List Tie. For example, the first card you find
in the pack is the 6 of Hearts, which is represented
by the word HASH, and you simply make a picture
of a TIE &amp; HASH.</p>

<p>The second card might be the 4 of Clubs, which
is represented by the word Cur, and made into a picture
with the second word of the Code List, Snow.</p>

<p>The third card might be the 3 of Spades, in which
case you would make a picture of Home and SEAM.</p>

<p>In a similar manner proceed to make a visual picture
for each card in the pack, as you come to it,
with the following word of your Code List. Then
when you have gone as far as you wish, pick up the
cards, being careful to keep them in the order in
which you have learned them, holding them with
their backs to you and their faces to those who are
watching. In order to name the first card simply
recall your picture with Tie which will bring to
mind the word HASH, which stands for the 6 of
Hearts. The second card will be Snow and CUR
for the 4 of Clubs. The third card will be Home
and SEAM or the 3 of Spades.</p>

<p>With practice you will be able to take the fifty-two
cards of the deck. At first it is advisable to take
only twenty or twenty-five, so that you can recall
your pictures soon after they have been made. The
more cards you take, the stronger picture you must
make to hold it accurately in mind without review.</p>

<h3>Mastering Robert's Rules of Order</h3>

<p>Everyone should be well posted regarding precedence
of motion in Parliamentary Law. You may be
called upon to decide such questions at any time.
The worries of officiating in public will be reduced
to a minimum if you will learn the proper sequence
of motions through the following suggestions. It
will require but a few minutes to do this. The following
is a list of motions given in the order in which
they take precedence. The motion which has precedence
over all others is the motion, To Fix the Time
to Adjourn, and is Number 1. The motion which
takes precedence over all motions, except Number 1,
is the motion, To Adjourn, and is Number 2.</p>


<h3>Privileged Motions</h3>

<p>
1&mdash;To fix the time to adjourn (non-debatable).<br />
2&mdash;To adjourn (non-debatable).<br />
3&mdash;Questions of privilege (debatable).
</p>


<h3>Incidental Motions</h3>

<p>
4&mdash;Call for orders of day (non-debatable).<br />
5&mdash;Appeal (debatable).<br />
6&mdash;Objection (non-debatable).<br />
7&mdash;To read paper (non-debatable).<br />
8&mdash;Leave to withdraw motion (non-debatable).<br />
9&mdash;To suspend the rules (non-debatable).
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>


<h3>Subsidiary Motions</h3>

<p>
10&mdash;To lay on the table (non-debatable).<br />
11&mdash;The previous question (non-debatable).<br />
12&mdash;To postpone to a certain day (debatable).<br />
13&mdash;To refer to committee (debatable).<br />
14&mdash;To amend (debatable).<br />
15&mdash;To postpone indefinitely (debatable).<br />
16&mdash;Main or principal motion (debatable).
</p>

<p>In order to learn the sequence, it is simply necessary
to make a Reminder Picture of the motion, and
Hitch it to the corresponding number, which of
course, must be represented by the words in your
Code List. For this purpose the following pictures
are suggested, using the list of Code Words. The
pictures given here are merely suggestions. Make
any pictures which will serve to call the motion to
mind.</p>

<p>1&mdash;TIE.&mdash;To Fix the Time to Adjourn.</p>

<p>See some men seated around a table playing a
game of cards. The prize for the winner is a large
red TIE lying on the table. One man points to the
clock and says, "We will play until ten-thirty o'clock,
and then go home." The TIE stands for 1, and the
picture suggests fixing the time to adjourn.</p>

<p>2&mdash;SNOW.&mdash;To Adjourn.</p>

<p>See some people seated around a dinner table.
Their attention is directed to the fact that it is snowing
and they all rise and go home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>3&mdash;HOME.&mdash;Questions of Privilege.</p>

<p>See some people leaving a meeting and starting
HOME, other jumping up and objecting, raising the
question of their privilege to leave.</p>

<p>4&mdash;WIRE.&mdash;Call for Orders of Day.</p>

<p>See a messenger boy all bound up with WIRE, calling
the orders of the day.</p>

<p>5&mdash;WHEEL.&mdash;Appeal.</p>

<p>See a man waving a WHEEL to gain attention and
calling for an appeal.</p>

<p>6&mdash;SASH.&mdash;Objection to the Consideration of the
Question.</p>

<p>See a member of the assembly pulling another
away by a SASH, to keep him from getting a chance
to ask a question which he wishes to have considered.
The first man objects to the consideration of the second
man's question.</p>

<p>7&mdash;EGG.&mdash;The Reading of Papers.</p>

<p>See an officer taking the papers out of a large EGG
shell and reading them.</p>

<p>8&mdash;IVY.&mdash;Leave to Withdraw Motion.</p>

<p>See a man reaching over with a piece of IVY and
trying to get a copy of the motion off from the desk.</p>

<p>9&mdash;WHIP.&mdash;To Suspend the Rules.</p>

<p>See a WHIP dangling a ruler suspended at its end.</p>

<p>10&mdash;TOES.&mdash;To Lay on the Table.</p>

<p>See a member come up and put his TOES on the
table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>11&mdash;DOT.&mdash;The Previous Question.</p>

<p>See a man trying to cover the previous question
with a large DOT.</p>

<p>12&mdash;TOWN.&mdash;To Postpone to a Certain Day.</p>

<p>See a town with posters all over it, with a large
date referring to a day set for meeting.</p>

<p>13&mdash;DIME.&mdash;To Refer to Committee.</p>

<p>See a committee standing up in line and a large dime
being handed to them.</p>

<p>14&mdash;DEER.&mdash;To Amend.</p>

<p>See some hunters trying to mend the DEERS
antlers.</p>

<p>15&mdash;TOWEL.&mdash;To Postpone Indefinitely.</p>

<p>A TOWEL is rolled up and placed on a high shelf,
its use is indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p>16&mdash;DISH.&mdash;The main or Principal Question.</p>

<p>See a large DISH carried in and put in the middle
of the table, indicating that it is the principal dish.</p>

<p>The question of whether or not these motions are
debatable is an important one. You will notice that
each question is marked "debatable" or "non-debatable."
The easiest way to fix this in mind is to take
them in groups. Notice that the motions from 1 to 11
are non-debatable, and that the motions from 12 to
16 are debatable.</p>

<p>The exceptions to this fact are the motions 3 and 5
which are debatable. In our Number Code M stands
for 3 and L for 5, represent the motions 3 and 5, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
M and L, made into the word MULE. These are debatable,
or can be "kicked" about, which idea is easily
associated with MULE. This will always keep in
mind that the only debatable motions of the first set
are the motions Mule.</p>

<p>Another question is, which motions require a two-thirds
vote to carry? They are the motions 6, 9 and
11. These three Numbers are represented by the
words SASH, WHIP and DOT, which can easily be
fixed in mind.</p>

<p>Whether the motion, TO LAY ON THE TABLE, or
the motion, TO SUSPEND RULES, should have precedence
can be decided by referring to your pictures.
To suspend the Rules brings the picture of the Whip
Suspending the Ruler from a string. To lay on the
Table brings the picture of a man putting his Toes on
the Table. Whip is 9 and Toes is 10, therefore you
know that to Suspend the Rule has the precedence.</p>


<h3>Aids for Bible Students</h3>

<p>Many very helpful ideas for Bible study may be
worked out by combining the different principles you
have been studying in memory development. The
whole Bible can become one great, moving Panorama.
The picture can contain all the detail which you wish
to remember.</p>

</table>


<h3>Location of Passage</h3>

<p>The location of a verse can be fixed in mind by the
use of Reminders and the Number Code. For example,
remember the idea, "THE APOSTLES MADE A
DOZEN." In this sentence "made" stands for Matthew,
"dozen" stands for 10 and 2; or the Apostles
are named in Matthew 10:2.</p>

<p>The names of the Apostles can be easily remembered
by the following Reminder Story:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Peter</td><td>and</td><td>James</td><td>join</td><td>Philip</td><td>Bartholomew</td></tr>
<tr><td>Peter</td><td>Andrew</td><td>James</td><td>John</td><td>Philip</td><td>Bartholomew</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>to make</td><td>Matthew</td><td>James</td><td>Thaddeus</td><td>Zion's</td><td>Justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thomas</td><td>Matthew</td><td>James</td><td>Thaddeus</td><td>Simon</td><td>Judas.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To remember where to find the Ten Commandments
remember the two words "Extra Nice." Extra
is a reminder for Exodus and Nice stands for 20th
Chapter.</p>

<p>The story of the Prodigal Son found in the 15th
Chapter of Luke is easily remembered by the idea,
"PRODIGAL SON LOOK DAILY." Look is a reminder
for Luke, and Daily stands for 15th Chapter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>The idea that the fond father looked daily for the
Prodigal Son will be easily remembered.</p>


<h3>Rhyme Often Helpful</h3>

<p>In every case possible take advantage of the fact
that rhyme is easy to remember. There are many examples
of this fact which have aided you in the past,
as for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Thirty days has September,<br />
April, June and November," etc.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many other common examples. The
following is a good illustration of how information
can be arranged in rhyme and thus aid materially in
fixing it in mind.</p>


<h3>Grammar by Rhyme</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Three little words you often see<br />
Are Articles A, AN, THE.<br />
<br />
A Noun's the name of anything.<br />
As SCHOOL or GARDEN, HOOP or SWING.<br />
<br />
Adjectives tell the kind of noun,<br />
As GREAT, SMALL, PRETTY, WHITE or BROWN.<br />
<br />
Instead of nouns the Pronouns stand:<br />
HIS head, HER face, YOUR army, MY hand.<br />
<br />
Verbs tell something to be done:<br />
To READ, COUNT, LAUGH, SING, JUMP or RUN.<br />
<br />
How things are done the Adverbs tell:<br />
As SLOWLY, QUICKLY, ILL or WELL.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span><br />
Conjunctions join the words together,<br />
As men AND women, wind OR weather.<br />
<br />
The Preposition stands before<br />
The noun, as IN or THROUGH the door.<br />
<br />
The Interjection shows surprise,<br />
As OH! How pretty! AH! How wise!<br />
<br />
The whole are called nine parts of speech<br />
Which reading, writing, speaking teach.<br />

<h3>Learning the Telegraphic Code</h3>

<p>An interesting and valuable application of the A,
B, C, Hitching Posts and Visualization is made on the
following pages as a basis of learning the International
Code as used by the army and navy.</p>

<p>Many persons have learned the code in a few hours
by this method, where it has taken days to master it
by repetition. The Morse Code has only a few
changes and can be learned by the same plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>Note the Pyramid arrangement of the signals in
groups of three and four. Also note that the signals
in columns 1 and 3 begin with DOTS, and those in
columns 2 and 4 begin with DASHES. Note that the
signals in the adjacent columns are opposite. A is
._; opposite in the adjacent column is _. N.</p>

<p>Learn the signals in groups as arranged.</p>

<p>As it is more difficult to translate from signal to
letter, the following instructions are based upon
learning from signal to letter. To learn in this manner
will shorten the time necessary in becoming able
to "receive" messages. Follow the instructions
closely.</p>


<h3>How to Learn the Code</h3>

<p>Each DOT or DASH of the signal is to be represented
by an object which you can see or visualize.
The alphabet letter is represented by an Object beginning
with that letter.</p>

<p>The signal objects and the letter objects are then
grouped into a picture. This picture visualized and

<p>Go over the pictures a section at a time as pyramided.
See them in large size and in motion. Do
this several times. Have some one call the signal to
you. See the ORANGES and PLANKS, or the BATS
and APPLES and the picture they form. The object
pictured with them brings the corresponding letter to
you.</p>

<p>Note that all signals beginning with a DOT are pictured
with ORANGES and PLANKS. All signals beginning
with a DASH are pictured with BATS and
APPLES.</p>

<p>By this simple method you are guided at once to
your picture. When this signal is given .._ at once
you know it is two oranges and a plank. This brings
the picture of the U-boat dashing between the
oranges and striking the plank. After a few repetitions
the process will become instantaneous.</p>

<p>Go over the alphabet forward and backward and
in each case SEEING and speaking the object used to
represent the letter. Thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>


<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>A&mdash;Ant</td><td>H&mdash;Hand</td><td>O&mdash;Owl</td><td>U&mdash;U-Boat</td></tr>
<tr><td>B&mdash;Bee</td><td>I&mdash;Ink</td><td>P&mdash;Pig</td><td>V&mdash;Vine</td></tr>
<tr><td>C&mdash;Cannon &nbsp;</td><td>J&mdash;Jockey</td><td> Q&mdash;Quilt &nbsp;</td><td>W&mdash;Wolf</td></tr>
<tr><td>D&mdash;Door</td><td> K&mdash;Kettle</td><td>R&mdash;Rat</td><td>X&mdash;X-Ray</td></tr>
<tr><td>E&mdash;Engine</td><td>L&mdash;Lamb</td><td>S&mdash;Snow</td><td>Y&mdash;YMCA</td></tr>
<tr><td>F&mdash;Fire</td><td>M&mdash;Monkey &nbsp;</td><td>T&mdash;Tea</td><td>Z&mdash;Zebra</td></tr>
<tr><td>G&mdash;Goose</td><td>N&mdash;Nun</td></tr>
</table>


<p>For practice go over the alphabet and see the object
and picture of the signal. Thus, A is Ant, see
the ant walking down the plank which is resting on
the orange. Repeat the signal A ._ Orange, Plank.
Do this a few times till all pictures are clear and
come quickly.</p>

<p>Let all your alphabetical practice be by seeing the
picture and speaking the signal. Thus, A, see the
picture and speak the signal, Dot, Dash.</p>

<p>See to it that most of your practice is from signal to
letter. This is "receiving" and requires the most
practice.</p>

<p>In your odd moments go over signals, thus, _ _._
two bats, an apple and a bat (wrapped in a Quilt) Q.</p>

<p>._ _ an orange and two planks (the Wolf walks
over) W.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Pictures insure accuracy, depend upon the picture.
Practice is the only possible method for
developing speed.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>The Knight's Tour</h3>

<p>Chess players find a great deal of interest and
amusement in being able to remember the moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
necessarily made by the Knight in touring the board,
stopping once on each square, and never more than
once on any square.</p>



<p>One of our great mathematicians put in a great
deal of time working out the proper moves of the
Knight in touring the board in this manner. It is a
simple matter for the memory student to keep in
mind the necessary moves in their proper order. This
would be an almost impossible feat without the aid of
your number code, as there are sixty-four different
moves to be made by the Knight in this tour.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The problem is to call from memory each move of
the Knight, beginning either at square No. 1, or in
fact any square of the board. Notice that the squares
are numbered from 1 to 64, each row of squares always
numbering from left to right. The following
cut illustrates the method of moves. The Knight always
moves two squares in one direction, and one in
the other, indicated by a diagonal line drawn from 1
to 11, and from 11 to 5. Thus you will see, beginning
with square No. 1 that the move of the Knight
will be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>



<p>1, 11, 5, 15, 32, 47, 64, 54, 60,
50, 35, 41, 26, 9, 3, 13, 7, 24,
39, 56, 62, 45, 30, 20, 37, 22,
28, 38, 21, 36, 19, 25, 10, 4, 14,
8, 23, 40, 55, 61, 51, 57, 42, 59,
53, 63, 48, 31, 16, 6, 12, 2, 17,
34, 49, 43, 58, 52, 46, 29, 44,
27, 33, 18 and back to 1.</p></blockquote>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>To remember these moves in their proper order is
an excellent application of the Hitching Post idea,
and use of the Code List representing the moves in
consecutive order as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., and any word with
it that will represent the number of the square to
which the Knight is to move. The list following begins
with the first square as the starting place:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Tie</td><td>and</td><td>Hut</td><td>Town</td><td>and</td><td>Riot</td></tr>
<tr><td>Snow</td><td>and</td><td>Dude</td><td>Dime</td><td>and</td><td>Hinge</td></tr>
<tr><td>Home</td><td>and</td><td>Owl</td><td>Deer</td><td>and</td><td>Ape</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wire</td><td>and</td><td>Doll</td><td>Towel</td><td>and</td><td>Ham</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wheel</td><td>and</td><td>Maine</td><td>Ditch</td><td>and</td><td>Team</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sash</td><td>and</td><td>Rug</td><td>Duck</td><td>and</td><td>Oak</td></tr>
<tr><td>Egg</td><td>and</td><td>Cherry</td><td>Taffy</td><td>and</td><td>Snare</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ivy</td><td>and</td><td>Lawyer &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>Depot</td><td>and</td><td>Imp</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whip</td><td>and</td><td>Chess</td><td>Nose</td><td>and</td><td>Latch</td></tr>
<tr><td>Toes</td><td>and</td><td>Lace</td><td>Net</td><td>and</td><td>China</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dot</td><td>and</td><td>Mill</td><td>Nun</td><td>and</td><td>Reel</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Follow on through the sixty-four moves using the
code words for the sequence of the move and any
words you wish that stand for the number of the
squares on the board.</p>

<p>When you have pictured all the objects together,
the first object will keep the sequence of the moves
clearly in mind, and the second will reveal the number
of the square to which the Knight is to move.
You can very quickly go over the pictures and give
the moves of the Knight. The first move, Tie, begins
with Hut or square No. 1. The second move, Snow,
is Dude or square 11; the third move, Home, is Owl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
or square 5; the fourth move, Wire, is Doll, or square
15; the fifth move, Wheel, is Maine, or square 32.
Each move is represented by the picture which you
have with the succeeding word of your code list.</p>

<p>As soon as you are familiar with these pictures
you can begin with any square designated. If you
are asked to begin with square 24 you know that 24
is Snare, which is pictured with Taffy. Taffy is 18,
so you begin with the 18th move.</p>


<h3>Knight's Tour by Story</h3>

<p>Another method of following the Knight's tour is
to learn the following story, the words of which are
based upon the Number Code, each word giving the
number of the square to which the Knight should
move next. The story begins with the square 1.
After you have learned the story, go over it and instead
of saying the words, speak the number of the
square as represented by the word of the story. This
first sentence is an example: The TIDE IS LOW, a
TALL MAN is ROWING. These words represent the
following figures: 1, 11, 5, 15, 32, 47.</p>

<p>First learn the story, then practice until you are
able to go over the whole thing and speak the figures
1, 11, 5, etc. After you are thoroughly acquainted
with the number values of the words you can allow
the persons looking on to select any square on the
board as the starting place. For instance, if square
32 should be selected you would know that the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
MAN stands for 32, and so you would begin with
MAN. The next move would be the next word,
ROWING (47), and so on through the story. When
you come to the end of the story you must go back to
the beginning and work forward to the word MAN,
so as to cover the entire board.</p>

<p>To learn the Knight's tour is excellent training,
and gives you an excellent method of entertaining
your friends, as they will scarcely believe it possible
that you can remember the 64 moves without error.</p>

<h3>A Last Word</h3>

<p>"Memory is the foundation without which there can
be no structure of knowledge." On the other hand,
there can be a good foundation and very little structure.
The story is told of a fool who was placed under
the charge of a country clergyman. The young
fellow would sit in church on the Sabbath and was
able to remember almost every word of the sermon.
He could tell afterwards, where every one sat, and
what they wore, but he was good for very little of
anything else.</p>

<p>A reporter in the House of Commons could sit for
hours without taking notes and write the full
speeches for his paper, but he had very poor judgment
and was an utter failure in life.</p>

<p>Do not neglect the development of your memory,
but do not go to the extreme, so that you neglect
other factors of mentality and character. Strive always
to gain a fully rounded education and development.
Develop the Common Senses; make them
keen, alert and useful, and you will not lack in Common
Sense.</p>

<p>Great buildings, great characters, great minds and
great memories are not built in a day. But a few
minutes a day of persistent effort will win. In the
words of Michael Angelo:</p>

<p>"Trifles make perfection, but perfection is no
trifle."</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
